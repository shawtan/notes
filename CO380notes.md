# CO 380: Mathematical Discovery and Invention

## Problem Solving Techniques

### Trial and Error
- Use when possible answers are limited

### Just do it

### Draw a useful diagram
- Make it big enough with enough labels

### Algebra
- Don't over complicate things

### Find a pattern
- It may not be the pattern you expect

### Try a simpler problem
- Gives insight into what is happening

### Look at the problem differently
- e.g Geometrically, splitting

### Working systematically
- Sytematically work through the given information and possibilities

### Break into cases 
- Breaks a hard problem into smaller problems

### Eliminate possibilities
- e.g. Establish a max or min
- e.g. Proof by contradiction

### Work backwards
- Logically deduce steps that led to the conclusion
- Use when end results are known and are asked for initial conditions
- Use when there is one goal but multiple approaches

### Think inductively
