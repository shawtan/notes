# CO 380: Mathematical Discovery and Invention

## Problem Solving Techniques

### Trial and Error
- Use when possible answers are limited

### Just do it

### Draw a useful diagram
- Make it big enough with enough labels

### Algebra
- Don't over complicate things

### Find a pattern
- It may not be the pattern you expect

### Try a simpler problem
- Gives insight into what is happening

### Look at the problem differently
- e.g Geometrically, splitting

### Working systematically
- Sytematically work through the given information and possibilities

### Break into cases
- Breaks a hard problem into smaller problems

### Eliminate possibilities
- e.g. Establish a max or min
- e.g. Proof by contradiction

### Work backwards
- Logically deduce steps that led to the conclusion
- Use when end results are known and are asked for initial conditions
- Use when there is one goal but multiple approaches

### Think inductively

### Roots of Polynomials
$$1-x^2 = (1-x)(1+x)$$
$$1-x^3 = (1-x)(1+x+x^2)$$
$$1+x^3 = (1+x)(1-x+x^2)$$
$$1−x^4 = (1−x^2)(1+x^2) = (1−x)(1+x)(1+x^2)$$
$$1−x^5 = (1−x)(1+x+x^2 +x^3 +x^4)$$
$$1−x^6 = (1−x^3)(1+x^3) = (1−x)(1+x)(1−x+x^2)(1+x+x^2)$$

### Math
#### AM-GM
If $x,y \geq 0$, $\frac{x+y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}$

#### QM-AM-GM-HM

$$\sqrt{\frac{x^2+y^2}{2}} \geq \frac{x+y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy} \geq \frac{2}{\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}}$$

$$\sqrt{\frac{x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2}{n}} \ge\frac{x_1+\cdots+x_n}{n}\ge\sqrt[n]{x_1\cdots x_n}\ge\frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{x_n}}$$

#### Cauchy-Schwarz
$$\vert a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 \vert \leq \sqrt{a_1^2+a_2^2}\sqrt{b_1^2+b_2^2}$$
$$\left(\sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_i\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2\right)$$

### Number Theory
#### Divisibility
$d$ | When is $n$ divisible by $d$?
--- | ---
1 | Every $n$
2 | Units digit is even
3 | Sum of digits is divisible by 3
4 | Last two digits is divisible by 4
5 | Units digit is 0 or 1
6 | $n$ is divisible by 2 and 3
7 | ???
8 | Last 3 digits are divisible by 8
9 | Sum of digits are divisible by 9
10 | Unites digit is 0
11 | Alternating sum of digits is divisible by 11
12 | $n$ is divisible by 4 and 3

### Counting

### Geometry
$$\frac{\text{Area}(\triangle ABD)}{\text{Area}(\triangle ACD)} = \frac{BD}{DC}$$
