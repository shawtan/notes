# PSYCH 256: Introduction to Cognitive Science

## Readings

### Turing: Thinking
- Can Machines 'think'?
- Imitation game to assess 'thinking'
    - If a interrogator is unable to differentiate a machine and a human, the machine can think

### McCarthy: Common Sense
- Advice taker system that takes in expressions and preforms deductions
- Given a set of predicates and rules, can you get from the premise to the conclusion?

### Newell: Intelligence
- Intelligence is important to cognitive science
- **Intelligence is the ability to best apply all the knowledge that one has in order to achieve a goal within finite time**
    - Depends on how effectively they apply information
    - How fast they make a decision
- There are different types of intelligence
    - Intelligence is hard to measure
- Intelligence is a search problem
    - Need to preform a *knowledge search* to figure out how to solve a problem
        - Specialized systems do not need a knowledge search because the same knowledge is used each time
        - Knowledge is stored in data structures to be efficiently searched
    - And *problem serach* to search for the right solution
        - Problem space is generated as the search continues

### Simon: Rules for math
- Production system is a set of (conditions, actions)
    - Can be data driven or goal driven
- e.g. Learning algebra rules

### Pinker: Rules for language

## 6. Analogy
- If two things share some features, we can infer they share some more
- Analogies can be captured as
    - Attributes
    - Relations
    - Systems
- Analogical reasoning is less reliable than rule based
- Analogies deal with comparisons of concepts
