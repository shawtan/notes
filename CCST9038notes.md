# CCST 9038: Science and Science Fiction
Notes by Xiao Tan

## What is Science Fiction?
- Fiction using scientific method to extend to a given set of changes
- If the story still works without the science elements, it is not science fiction

### Science in Science Fiction
1. Idea originated in SciFi, later realized by science
    - Communications satellites
    - Computers
    - Internet
2. Idea originated in science, popularized by SciFi writers
    - Asteroid collision
    - Antimatter
    - Black holes
3.  Idea originated in SciFi, possible to be realized in near future
    - Cloning
    - Genetic engineering
    - Artificial Intelligence
    - Cyborgs
4.  Idea originated in SciFi, theoretically possible according to present knowledge, but very far from realization
    - Androids,
    - Space elevator
    - Antigravity
    - Alternate Universes
    - Deep space exploration and colonization
    - Cryonics
    - Time Travel

#### Science Concepts
##### Drake's Equation
- Probability of finding other intelligent life
- Based on:
    - Number of stars
    - % of stars with planets
    - % planets with favorable environment
    - % of planets where life forms
    - % of life that is intelligent
    - % of civilizations capable of communication
    - Longevity of civilization

##### Velocity of light: constant c
##### Speed vs Velocity
##### Frame of reference
- Speed / distance measured with respect to a frame of reference

##### Acceleration
##### Newton's Laws of Motion
1. A body at rest remains at rest or moves at a constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force
2. F = ma
3. For every force there is an equal and opposite force

##### Momentum (p = mv)
- Impulse = change in momentum
- Conservation of momentum

##### Energy
- Law of conservation of energy:
    - Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another

##### Centripetal Force
- Used to simulate gravity
    - Requires a big structure for similar force on feet and head

##### Escape Velocity
- Minimum velocity of escape planet surface

##### Antimatter
- Negatively charged nuclei surrounded by positrons
- Large energy output when combined with matter

##### Radioactive Decay
- Disintegration of unstable nuclei releasing particles and energy

##### Nuclear Fission and Fusion
- Fission = Decay of heavy elements
- Fusion = converting light elements to heavier ones

##### Relativity
- Time dilation, length contraction, mass increase

#### Space Travel
- Ship design
- Propulsion
- Energy generation

##### Dyson Sphere
- Harvesting energy from a star will alter the detectable radiation of the star
- Can use this to find intelligent life

### Nanotechnology
### Climate Change
##### Greenhouse Effect
- Gasses in atmosphere absorb sun radiation and reradiate it
- Gasses: Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated compounds

### Scientists
- Science is a team effort
- Dependent on past and current contributions
- Requires peer review before publishing
- Results must be reproducible

### Social Issues
- SciFi gives a new background to highlight issues in a different context
- e.g Cultural biases, gender, religion, war, education, class

## Real Life Examples
### Evolution
- Sickle cell trait in humans prevents malaria
- Eyes see things upside down, has a blind spot
- Appendix is useless

### Ecology
- Carp is an invasive species world wide due to no natural predators
- Store strawberries are hybrids and don't regrow well, fruit is irradiated to prevent spoiling

### Wealth
- US presidential election take donations from companies
- Walmart, McDonalds give workers 31 hours, because 32 hours requires benefits
- The **tragedy of the commons** is a problem that occurs when individuals exploit a shared resource to the extent that demand overwhelms supply and the resource becomes unavailable to some or all.

### Feminism

### Science
- Assimilation vs Accommodation of knowledge
