# GEOG 101

## Ch1: Introduction to Human Geography
- Pages E-Text: 2-33
- The Arab Spring was the result of many global events that led to higher bread prices
- **Places**: specific geographic settings with distinctive physical, social and cultural attributes
- **Regions**: territories that encompass many _places_ that share attributes
- Geography helps use understand the world
- **Human Geography**: study of spatial organization of human activity and people's relationships with their environment

### Places
- Dynamic - changes properties and boundaries due to environment and human factors
- Influences people's physical well-being, opportunities, lifestyle choices
- Places hold meaning for differnet people
- **Identity**: the sense that you make of yourself through your subjective feelings based on your everyday experiences and social relations
- Significant events occur in places
- Social interaction occurs in places
    - Structures daily routines
    - Provides opportunities and constraints
    - Context for common-sense and experience
    - Setting for socialization
    - Arena for contesting social norms

### Human Geography
- **Physical Geography**: Earth's natural processes and outcomes
- **Regional Geography**: How environmental and human factors produce terriorties with distinctive landscapes and cultural attributes
- Tools
    - Observation
        - Fieldwork
        - Lab experiments
        - Remote sensing (Using aerial photography / satellite imagery to collect information)
    - Visualization and Representation
    - Analysis

#### Maps
- Representations of the world
- What they contain and omit reveal experiences, priorities, interpretations and intentions of their authors
- Types
    - Topographic: Form of earth's surface
        - Contour lines connect equal elevation
    - Thematic: Spatial dimensions of conditions / processes/ events
        - Isoline maps connect equal data value (e.g precipitation)
        - Proportional symbols use density to represent frequency
    - Dot: Single dot/symbol for num occurences
    - Choropleth: Gradient tonal shadings reflects numver variations
- Map scale: ratio between linear distance on a map and linear distance on Earth's surface
    - Corresponding lengths or Representative fraction (ratio)
- Map projections: systematic rendering of earth on a flat surface
    - Equidistant: distance is accurate in one direction
    - Conformal: renders compass directions accurately
    - Azimuthal: compass directions are correct from one point
    - Equivalent / Equal-area: Areas are portrayed in true proportions
    - Cartogram: space is transformed based on some stat

#### Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Organized set of computer hardware, software and spatially coded data to capture, store, update, manipulate, and display geographic references
- Data must have longitude, latitude, elevation
- Allows merging of data from different sources and topics

### Spatial Analysis
- Study of geography as their arrangement on a map

#### Location
- Can be
    - Nominal: expressed in terms of names
    - Absolute: expressed in terms of coordinates
        - Latitude = how north / south
        - Longitude = how east / west
    - Relative: in terms of site or situation
        - Site: physical attributes of location (terrain, soil, etc)
        - Situation: location relative to other places / activities
    - Cognitive (mental map): psychological representations of locations

#### Distance
- Absolute: in km
- Relative: in terms of time, effort, or cost
- Cognitive: perceived distance
- **Friction of distance**: deterrent / inhibiting effect of distance on human activity
- **Distance-decay function**: rate where an activity decreases with distance
    - e.g Don't commute to Waterloo for a job
- Nearness principle
    1. Max overall utility of places at min effort
    2. Max connections between places at min cost
    3. Locate related activities close together

#### Space
- Absolute
- Topological: connections between points in space
    - Measured by nature and degree of connectivity
- Relative:
    - Socioeconomic: measures of cost, profit, productivity
    - Cognitive: People's values, feelings, beliefs, perceptions
- Activities produce space (e.g setting up a town center)

#### Accessibility
- Opportunity for contact/interaction from a location relative to other locations
- *Connectivity*: channels of communication and transportation

#### Spatial Interaction
- Movement and flows involving human activity
- Principles
    - Complementarity
        1. Demand and supply must match
        2. International division of labour
        3. Specialization + economies of scale
    - Transferability
        - Cost of moving an item vs ability of item to bear costs
        - Improved by *infrastructure* and *time-space convergence*
    - Intervening opportunities
        - Alternative origins or destinations
    - Spatial diffusion
        - How things (e.g innovation, disease, politics, music) spread through space and time
        - Expansion: spread due to proximity
        - Hierarchical: spread that skips in-between places
        - Relocation: spread due to people movement

### Regional Analysis
- Similarities and differences among and between places

#### Regionalization
- Classifying **areal units** (individual places)
- Look at regions with coherent structure, econimics, politics, social organization
- *Core-Domain-Sphere* model: 
    - Core: Distinctive attribute very clear
    - Domain: Dominant, but not exclusive
    - Sphere: Present, but not dominant

#### Landscape
- Complex repository of society
- **Ordinary** (vernacular) landscape: everyday landscapes created from life
- **Symbolic** lanscape: particular values / aspirations leaders want to impart on the public

#### Sense of Place
- People's feelings towards a place due to experiences and memories
- Insiders
    - Shared dress code, speech patterns
    - 'Third places'
- Outsiders
    - Local landmarks, ways of life that are familar

### Developing a Geographical Imagination
- lol why



## Ch 3: Population Geography
- Pages E-Text: 72-109
- Population counts are political
    - Determines number of representatives in government
    - Determines amount of tax revenue the region receives
    - e.g Iraq does not want to conduct a census because it will determine who controls the oil fields
- **Demographics**: characteristics of a *human population* including gender, race, age, income, disabilities, education, migration patterns

### Demographic Tools
- **Demography**: Study of characteristics of human populations
- Try to study distribution of people

#### Censuses and Vital Records
- Census: Count of people in a country / region / city
    - Lots of data
    - Only a snapshot
- Vital record: reports of birth, death, marriage, divorce, disease
    - Limited individuals
    - Tracks changes over time
- Combining census and vital record gives more information, much has privacy implications
- Limitations:
    - Expensive
    - Not comprehensive (underrepresents non-mainstream households)
- India held a biometric census that was cheap and through

#### Population Distribution and Structure
##### Population Distribution
- Population is shaped by 
    - accessibility, topography, soil fertility, climate, water, natural resources
    - a country's politics and economics
    - religious reasons
- Asia is most populated
- Most people are near oceans or rivers
- 90% people are north of equator

##### Population density and composition
- **Crude Density**: number of people / total land area
- **Nutritional Density**: total population / cultivated land
- **Health care density**: total population / number of physicians
- Composition information
    - Proportion of older people helps us allocate health care
    - Proportion of child-bearing aged females helps predict population growth
        - Also education of females

##### Age-Sex pyramids
- e.g Can reveal effects of WWI, WWII on Germany's population
- Rapid growth pyramid (Peripheral Country):
    - Wider base than middle
    - Need resources to care for children
    - Need to create more jobs when children grow up
- Slow/No growth pyramid (Core country):
    - More middle cohort than youth
    - Below replacement level
    - Population evenly distributed among cohorts
- *Dependency Ratio*: economic impact of young and old on working members of population
- Cohorts:
    - Youth: <15 years
    - Middle: age 15 - 64
    - Old: >65 years
- Baby Boom
    - Occurred after WWII
    - Caused by positive outlook of life
    - Ended by contraceptives and women entering workforce
    - Currently more older people than children    

### Population Dynamics and Processes
- Population Growth = Births - Deaths + (Immigration - Emigration)

#### Birth Rates
- **Crude birth rate**: live births in a year / every thousand people
    - Rich countries have lower CBR
- **Total fertility rate**: average number of children a woman will have during her childbearing years (15-49)

#### Death Rates
- **Crude death rate**: deaths in a year / 1000 people
- Men and elderly have higher death rates
- Poorer groups have higher death rates
- Variations
    - Infant mortality rate: infants < 1 year / 1000 live births
    - Life expectancy: average number of years an infant is expected to live
        - Differs by sex and race
- Epidemics affect life expectancy
    - HIV/AIDS
        - USA: more drug users and homosexual males
        - Canada: more aboriginals and inmates
        - Africa: more hetero-sexual non-drug users

#### Demographic Transition Theory
- Fertility and mortality rates are tied to level of economic development
- **Demographic Transition**: Model where high birth and death rates become low birth and death rates
    - Occurs with higher economic production and standards of living
    - First death rate falls, then birth rate falls
    - Based on industrialized countries. May not be generalizable to peripheral countries

### Population Movement and Migration
- Migration changes population

#### Mobility and Migration
- **Mobility**: ability to move from a place to another 
    - permanent or temporary
    - short or long distance
- **Migration**: long-distance move to a new location
    - change of residence
- Migration is tracked
    - Leaving skilled workers in Cuba
    - Influx of cheap migrants in US
    - 'Brain drain'
- **Gross Mirgation**: Total number of migrants moving in or out
- **Net Migration**: gain or loss in population due to migration
- **Push factors** cause people to move away
- **Pull factors** attracts people to a place

#### International Voluntary Migration
- Canada receives a lot of voluntary immigrants
    - Initial settlers from asia
    - French and British
    - Asian immigrants
- **Transnational migrants**: migrants with homes in multiple countries
    - e.g HK people that bought Vancouver housing
- Temporary labour migration: when workers go abroad and send money back
    - Reduces unemployment back home
    - Money from workers sending remittances back

#### International Forced Migration
- Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)
    - Only 1/3 of people leaving cross a border
- Reasons
    - War
        - e.g War on Terror in Iraq
        - e.g Arab-Israeli War
    - Famine
    - Government coercion or oppression
    - Slavery from Africa
    - Modern slavery
        - Undocumented workers cannot go to authorities
    - Natural disasters
    - Eco-migration
        - Due to degradation of land and natural resources
        - e.g Flat islands (Maldives, Seychelles)

#### Internal Voluntary Migration
- People move due to economic opportunities in provinces
- Population changes - migrants are usually young and educated
- China: Large migration of rural to urban
    - Government wants to increase industrial productivity

#### Internal Forced Migration
- USA: Aboriginals were forced to leave their homelands
- Canada: Relocated Inuit people to High Arctic

### Population Debates and Policies
- How many people can Earth sustain?

#### Population, Resources, and the Environment
- Malthus: Population growth will exceed available resources
- Need to prevent population from outgrowing available jobs and resources

#### Population Policies
- Official government strategy to change the size, composition or distribution of a population
- Urbanization naturally decreases fertility rate
- e.g China One Child Policy (1979 - 2014)
    - TFR drop from 5.5 to 1.7
    - Average age increase from 25 to 35
    - Challenge to support aging population
    - Potential economic crisis (like Japan)
    - Gender imbalance
- Other population control
    - Offer contraceptives
    - Family planing
    - Incentives to have less children
    - Educate women
        - So they don't need children for social recognition
    - Gender equality

#### Sustainable Development
- UN has 17 sustainable development goals (SDG), replacing the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
    - Focus on all countries improving, instead of rich helping poor
    - Call for peace and good governance
    - Specific goals addressing biodiversity, deforestation, marine life
    - Reflects exploding urbanization by calling for sustainable and resilient cities
- To slow population growth, we need
    - good quality of life
    - empower women

### Population, Health and Environment
- **Epidemiological Transition model**: theory that the prevailing illness changes from infectious to degenerative after the demographic transition
    - degenerative diseases are caused by aging, changing life-styles and environmental toxicity
- Urban areas have better health care than rural
- Higher income people live longer
- Life expectancy in regions across canada seem random
- Life expectancy influenced by
    - Health-threatening activities (e.g smoking)
    - Health-promoting activities (e.g sports, healthy eating)
