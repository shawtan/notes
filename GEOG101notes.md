# GEOG 101

## Ch 1: Introduction to Human Geography
- Pages: 2-33
- The Arab Spring was the result of many global events that led to higher bread prices
- **Places**: specific geographic settings with distinctive physical, social and cultural attributes
    - Physical setting for human activity
    - Dynamic
    - Shapes human values, attitudes, behaviours
    - Influences well-being, opportunities and future lives
    - Meaning is subjective
- **Regions**: territories that encompass many _places_ that share attributes
- Geography helps us understand the world
- **Human Geography**: study of spatial organization of human activity and people's relationships with their environment

### Places
- Dynamic - changes properties and boundaries due to environment and human factors
- Influences people's physical well-being, opportunities, lifestyle choices
- Places hold meaning for different people
- **Identity**: the sense that you make of yourself through your subjective feelings based on your everyday experiences and social relations
- Significant events occur in places
- Social interaction occurs in places
    - Structures daily routines
    - Provides opportunities and constraints
    - Context for common-sense and experience
    - Setting for socialization
    - Arena for contesting social norms

### Human Geography
- **Physical Geography**: Earth's natural processes and outcomes
    - e.g Climate, weather, land forms, soils, surface water, plants and animals
- **Regional Geography**: How environmental and human factors produce territories with distinctive landscapes and cultural attributes
    - Combination of Physical and Human geography
    - e.g Resources and hazards, environmental impacts
- **Human Geography**: study of spatial organization of human activity and people's relationships with their environment
    - e.g Cultural, religious, political systems
    - e.g Recreation, tourism, transportation, human settlements, economic systems, population
- Tools
    - Observation
        - Fieldwork
        - Lab experiments
        - Remote sensing (Using aerial photography / satellite imagery to collect information)
    - Visualization and Representation
    - Analysis

#### Maps
- Representations of the world
- Reveals 'invisible' patterns and features
- What they contain and omit reveal experiences, priorities, interpretations and intentions of their authors
- Types
    - Topographic: Form of earth's surface
        - Contour lines connect equal elevation
    - **Thematic**: Shows the distribution, flow or connection of characteristic
        <!-- - Spatial dimensions of conditions / processes/ events -->
        - **Isoline** maps have lines connecting equal data value
            - e.g precipitation
        - Proportional symbols use density to represent frequency
    - **Dot**: Single dot/symbol for number of occurrences
        - Shows dispersion or clustering of a distribution
    - **Choropleth**: Shows quantity or type of phenomena by area
        - e.g Shaded heat maps
    <!-- Gradient tonal shadings reflects number variations -->
- Map scale: ratio between linear distance on a map and linear distance on Earth's surface
    - Corresponding lengths or Representative fraction (ratio)
- Map projections: systematic rendering of earth on a flat surface
    - Equidistant: distance is accurate in one direction
        - e.g Polyconic
    - Conformal: renders compass directions accurately
        - e.g Mercator
    - Azimuthal: compass directions are correct only from one point
        - e.g Azimuthal equidistant
    - Equivalent / Equal-area: Areas are portrayed in true proportions
        - e.g Mollweide
    - Robinson projection: looks nice
        - e.g National Geographic
    - Cartogram: space is transformed based on some stat
        - e.g Relative country size based on proportion of people living on <$10 a day
![map projections](map_projections.png)

#### Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Organized set of computer hardware, software and spatially coded data to capture, store, update, manipulate, and display geographic references
- Data must have longitude, latitude, elevation
- Allows merging of data from different sources and topics
- Benefits
    - Easy customization and updating
    - Precision and accessibility
    - Anyone can contribute
    - Initial high cost, then low cost to maintain
    - Incorporates complexity
    - Multi-scalar (can be of different scales)
    - Data linked to location

### Spatial Analysis
- Study of geography as their arrangement on a map
- Movement and interconnections between places
- e.g Travel times between places

#### Location
- Can be
    - Nominal: names
    - Absolute: precise coordinates
        - **Latitude** = how north / south
        - **Longitude** = how east / west
    - **Relative**: position relative to other features
        - in terms of site or situation
            - Site: physical attributes of location (terrain, soil, etc)
            - Situation: location relative to other places / activities
    - Cognitive (**mental map**): psychological representations of locations
        - Reveals knowledge, priorities, psychology, lack of awareness, incorrect knowledge
        - Used to identity service gaps, awareness gaps, invisible (e.g gang) features, differences between people, personal attributes

#### Distance
- Absolute: in km
- Relative: in terms of time, effort, or cost
- Cognitive: perceived distance
- **Friction of distance**: Distance exerts a 'force'
    - deterrent / inhibiting effect of distance on human activity
- **Distance-decay function**: Near things are more related than distant things
    - rate where an activity decreases with distance
    - e.g Don't commute to Waterloo for a job
- **Frictionless zone**: distance where you're so close it doesn't matter
- **Nearness principle**
    1. Max overall utility of places at min effort
    2. Max connections between places at min cost
    3. Locate related activities close together

#### Space
- Absolute
- Topological: connections between points in space
    - Measured by nature and degree of connectivity
- Relative:
    - Socioeconomic: measures of cost, profit, productivity
    - Cognitive: People's values, feelings, beliefs, perceptions
- Activities produce space (e.g setting up a town center)

#### Accessibility
- Opportunity for contact/interaction from a location relative to other locations
- *Connectivity*: channels of communication and transportation

#### Spatial Interaction
- Influences use of space:
    - Awareness, cultural tendencies, money, transportation modes, distance
- Movement and flows involving human activity
- Principles
    - **Complementarity**
        1. Supply in one place and demand in another
        2. International division of labour
        3. Specialization + economies of scale
    - **Transferability**
        - Acceptable cost and timing
        - Cost of moving an item vs ability of item to bear costs
        - Improved by *infrastructure* and *time-space convergence*
    - **Intervening opportunities**
        - Alternative origins or destinations
        - e.g closer destinations
- Spatial diffusion
    - How things (e.g innovation, disease, politics, music) spread through space and time
    - **Expansion**: spread due to proximity
    - **Hierarchical**: spread that skips in-between places
    - **Relocation**: spread due to people movement
        - e.g Emigrating to another country

### Regional Analysis
- Similarities and differences among and between places
- e.g Entertainment District in GTA
- Problem: no clear borders
- Solution: use attributes
    - Physical attributes: terrain, climate, resources, soils, vegetation
    - Cultural attributes: practices, architecture, businesses, religious structures, human landscape modifications

#### Regionalization
- Classifying **areal units** (individual places)
- Look at regions with coherent structure, economics, politics, social organization
- *Core-Domain-Sphere* model: 
    - **Core**: All attributes present
        - Distinctive attribute very clear
    - **Domain**: Most attributes present
        - Dominant, but not exclusive
    - **Sphere**: Some attributes present
        - Present, but not dominant

#### Landscape
- Complex repository of society
- **Ordinary** (vernacular) landscape: everyday landscapes created from life
    - Influences perceptions, values, behaviours
    - Dynamic (changes over time)
    - e.g Highway traffic
- **Symbolic** landscape: particular values / aspirations leaders want to impart on the public
    - Represents values and aspirations
    - National identity
    - Protected 'as is'
    - e.g Great Wall

#### Sense of Place
- People's feelings towards a place due to lived experiences and memories
- e.g Culture, 'way of life', sports teams, cuisine, landscape, regional identity
- Insiders
    - Shared dress code, speech patterns
    - 'Third places'
- Outsiders
    - Local landmarks, ways of life that are familiar

<!-- ### Developing a Geographical Imagination
- lol why -->



## Ch 3: Population Geography
- Pages: 72-109
- Population counts are political
    - Determines number of representatives in government
    - Determines amount of tax revenue the region receives
    - e.g Iraq does not want to conduct a census because it will determine who controls the oil fields
- **Demographics**: characteristics of a *human population* including gender, race, age, income, disabilities, education, migration patterns

### Demographic Tools
- **Demography**: Study of characteristics of human populations
- Try to study distribution of people
- **Census**: Count of people in a country / region / city
    - Lots of data
    - Only a snapshot
- **Intercensal Estimates**
- **Vital records**: reports of birth, death, marriage, divorce, disease
    - Limited individuals
    - Tracks changes over time
- Combining census and vital record gives more information, but has privacy implications
- Limitations:
    - Expensive
    - Not comprehensive (underrepresents non-mainstream households)
- India held a biometric census that was cheap and thorough

#### Population Distribution and Structure
##### Population Distribution
- Population is shaped by 
    - accessibility, topography, soil fertility, climate, water, natural resources
    - a country's politics and economics
    - religious reasons
- Distribution:
    - Asia is most populated
    - Most people are near oceans or rivers
    - 90% people are north of equator
    - Mostly in temperate places (no arctic or mountaintops)

##### Population density and composition
- **Crude Density**: number of people / total land area
- **Nutritional Density**: total population / cultivated land
- **Health care density**: total population / number of physicians
- Composition information
    - Proportion of older people helps us allocate health care
    - Proportion of child-bearing aged females helps predict population growth
        - Also education of females

##### Age-Sex pyramids
> GOOD EXAM QUESTION

- Predicts future population size
- e.g Can reveal effects of WWI, WWII on Germany's population
- Rapid growth pyramid (Peripheral Country):
    - Wider base than middle
    - Need resources to care for children
    - Need to create more jobs when children grow up
- Slow/No growth pyramid (Core country):
    - More middle cohort than youth
    - Below replacement level
    - Population evenly distributed among cohorts
- *Dependency Ratio*: economic impact of young and old on working members of population
- Cohorts:
    - Youth: <15 years
    - Middle: age 15 - 64
    - Old: >65 years
- Baby Boom
    - Occurred after WWII
    - Caused by positive outlook of life
    - Ended by contraceptives and women entering workforce
    - Currently more older people than children    
![germany_population_pyramid](germany_population_pyramid.png)

### Population Dynamics and Processes
- Population Growth = Births - Deaths + (Immigration - Emigration)
- **Rate of Natural Increase (RNI)** = CBR - CDR (doesn't include immigration)
    - High RNI indicates less developed country

#### Birth Rates
- **Crude birth rate**: live births in a year / every thousand people
    - Rich countries have lower CBR
    - High CBR means
        - Young population
        - Low education levels
        - Underemployment (esp women)
        - Low availability of birth control
        - Less developed country
- **Total fertility rate**: average number of children a woman will have during her childbearing years (15-49)
    - High TFR implies less developed country

#### Death Rates
- **Crude death rate**: deaths in a year / 1000 People
    - High CDR means
        - Poor healthcare
        - Lack on government investment in health
        - Poor parents
        - Less developed country or aging population
- Men and elderly have higher death rates
- Poorer groups have higher death rates
- Variations
    - **Infant mortality rate**: infants deaths < 1 year / 1000 live births
    - **Life expectancy**: average number of years an infant is expected to live
        - Differs by sex and race
- Epidemics affect life expectancy
    - HIV/AIDS
        - USA: more drug users and homosexual males
        - Canada: more aboriginals and inmates
        - Africa: more hetero-sexual non-drug users

#### Demographic Transition Theory
> GOOD EXAM QUESTION

- Theory that as a country modernizes, fertility and mortality rates will drop, but at different times
    - Occurs with higher economic production and standards of living
    - First death rate falls, then birth rate falls
        - Rapid population increase during this time
    - Based on industrialized countries. May not be generalizable to peripheral countries
- Phases
    1. Pre-industrial: High birth and death rate, low population
    2. Transitional: Dropping death rate, growing population
    3. Transitional: Low death rate, dropping birth rate, growing population
    4. Industrial: Low birth and death rate, high population
    5. (Post-Industrial): Slightly-increasing death rate, dropping population
![demographic_transition_model](demographic_transition_model.png)

### Population Movement and Migration
- Migration changes population

#### Mobility and Migration
- **Mobility**: ability to move from a place to another 
    - *cyclical* or *permanent*
    - short or long distance
- **Migration**: long-distance, long-term move to a new location
    - change of residence
- Migration is tracked
    - Leaving skilled workers in Cuba
    - Influx of cheap migrants in US
    - 'Brain drain'
- **Gross Migration**: Total number of migrants moving in or out
- **Net Migration**: gain or loss in population due to migration
- Controls for migration
    - Distance and distance decay
    - Intervening opportunities
    - **Push factors** cause people to move away
        - Environmental factors: 
            - land degradation
            - natural hazards
            - sea levels
            - pollution
            - *climate change*
        - Diseases
    - **Pull factors** attracts people to a place
- Degree of choice
    - *Voluntary*
        - Economic migrants (work)
        - Accompany family members
        - Education
        - Land
    - *Reluctant*
        - Conflict
        - ethnic cleansing
        - internal relocation
        - environmental refugees
    - *Forced / Involuntary*
        - War
        - slavery
        - forcible repatriation
        - natural disasters
        - Natural disaster displacement is short-term vs conflict displacement
- Consequences of migration
    - Demographic: changes size, age, ethnicity of population
    - Economic: positive or negative
    - Social: cultural assimilation or conflict

#### International Voluntary Migration
- Canada receives a lot of voluntary immigrants
    - Initial settlers from Asia
    - French and British
    - Asian immigrants
- **Transnational migrants**: migrants with homes in multiple countries
    - e.g HK people that bought Vancouver housing
- Temporary labour migration: when workers go abroad and send money back
    - Reduces unemployment back home
    - Money from workers sending remittances back

#### International Forced Migration
- Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)
    - Only 1/3 of people leaving cross a border
- Reasons
    - War
        - e.g War on Terror in Iraq
        - e.g Arab-Israeli War
    - Famine
    - Government coercion or oppression
    - Slavery from Africa
    - Modern slavery
        - Undocumented workers cannot go to authorities
    - Natural disasters
    - Eco-migration
        - Due to degradation of land and natural resources
        - e.g Flat islands (Maldives, Seychelles)

#### Internal Voluntary Migration
- People move due to economic opportunities in provinces
- Population changes - migrants are usually young and educated
- China: Large migration of rural to urban
    - Government wants to increase industrial productivity

#### Internal Forced Migration
- Political decisions
- IDPs: Internally-displaced people. Growing in number
- China: cultural revolution 'Down to the Countryside Movement'
- USA: Aboriginals were forced to leave their homelands
- Canada: Relocated Inuit people to High Arctic

### Population Debates and Policies
- How many people can Earth sustain?

#### Population, Resources, and the Environment
- Malthus: Population growth will exceed available resources
- Need to prevent population from outgrowing available jobs and resources

#### Population Policies
- Official government strategy to change the size, composition or distribution of a population
- Urbanization naturally decreases fertility rate
- Other population control
    - Offer contraceptives
    - Family planing
    - Incentives to have less children
    - Educate women
        - So they don't need children for social recognition
    - Gender equality
- Coercive vs Non-coercive policies
    - **Coercive**
        - Set by government
        - Incentives and penalties
        - Tracking mechanisms
        - Social engineering
    - **Non-coercive**
        - Incentives
        - Promotion of conditions that reduce birthrate
            - e.g education, contraceptives, gender equality, economic development
- Pro-natalist policies
    - e.g Singapore
    - Pro-marriage policy
    - Subsidized childcare, tax rebates for additional children
    - Baby bonuses

##### Effects of China's One Child Policy (1979 - 2014)
- TFR drop from 5.5 to 1.7
- Average age increase from 25 to 35
- Challenge to support aging population
- Potential economic crisis (like Japan)
- Lost Girls
    - Boys are preferred because they carry on the family name and stay to take care of the parents
    - Girls are abandoned, aborted, hidden (unregistered) or killed
    - Gender cannot be revealed from ultrasounds
- Gender Imbalance
    - Men cannot find a wife and establish a family
    - Leads to crimes (abductions, forced marriages, selling of women)
- Little Emperors
    - Parents only have one child, so they are spoiled and fat
    - 4-2-1 Problem: Child will have many older generations to take care of
- New employment categories
    - Foster parents to look after children until they find parents
    - Abducted women detectives
    - Campaigns to promote gender equality
- Americans go to China to adopt kids
- Increase in twins from fertility treatment
- Birth tourism: Chinese going overseas to have their children
- Progress on gender equity


#### Sustainable Development
- UN has 17 sustainable development goals (SDG), replacing the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
    - Focus on all countries improving, instead of rich helping poor
    - Call for peace and good governance
    - Specific goals addressing biodiversity, deforestation, marine life
    - Reflects exploding urbanization by calling for sustainable and resilient cities
- Worried about unchecked population growth
- To slow population growth, we need
    - good quality of life
    - empower women

### Population, Health and Environment
- **Epidemiological Transition model**: theory that the prevailing illness changes from infectious to degenerative after the demographic transition
    - degenerative diseases are caused by aging, changing life-styles and environmental toxicity
- Urban areas have better health care than rural
- Higher income people live longer
- Life expectancy in regions across canada seem random
- Life expectancy influenced by
    - Health-threatening activities (e.g smoking)
    - Health-promoting activities (e.g sports, healthy eating)

## Ch 4: Geography of Health and Disease
- **Medical Geography**: application of geographic ideas, information, and theories to the study of disease, health, and health care
- Links movement, cultural aspects and human-environment relationships
- Types of disease diffusion
    - **Contagious (Expansion)**: person-to-person
    - **Relocation**: physical movement to a new  place
    - **Hierarchical**: doesn't really apply to illness
- e.g health care distribution

### Health and Geography
- Human-Environment Relationships
    - Wet, swampy areas = mosquito breeding grounds that spread disease
    - Diets differ depending on cold vs warm, wet vs dry
    - Some places are more prone to natural disasters
    - Pollution linked to epidemics
- Culture
    - e.g Cultural views on abortion
    - e.g Polygyny means higher spread of STDs (AIDS)
- Movement
    - How does disease move between areas?

### Human Ecology of Disease
- **Ecology**: relationship between organisms and their environment
- **Human ecology**: interconnections between human populations and the physical world
- e.g A farmed out area results in nutrition deficiencies in the community
- Insults/Stimuli: factors that affect health
    - Chemical: drugs, carbon monoxide exposure, etc
    - Physical: accidents, radiation poisoning, electrical shock
    - Infectious: viruses, bacteria, protozoa
    - Psychosocial: crowding, anxiety, love, sense of belonging
- Insults can manifest at different scales
- Human Ecology:
    - **Population**: a group's age, gender and genetic characteristics
        - e.g Older populations have more cancer
        - e.g Chinese metabolize alcohol slower
    - **Habitat**: natural, cultural and human-made aspects of an environment
        - e.g Urban environments have higher asthma
    - **Behaviour**: effect of cultural beliefs and social organization
        - e.g Some cultures practice traditional medicine
        - e.g American eating habits

### Disease Basics
- Patterns:
    - **Endemic**: A disease that is always present
        - e.g Chicken pox
    - **Epidemic**: Disease that occurs in large numbers than expected
        - e.g Flu, AIDS
    - **Pandemic**: Epidemic that covers a large area or the world
        - e.g HIV/AIDS
- Transmission:
    - **Agent**: organism that causes a disease
        - e.g bacteria, virus
    - **Host**: life form that got the disease
        - e.g human, pig
    - **Vector**: how the agent transmitted to the host
        - e.g mosquito, flies
    - **Diffusion Pathway**: How the disease diffuses

### SARS
- Transmitted between humans and animals
- Originated in Hong Kong
- Spread across the world through air travel
- Diffusion:
    - Contagious (hotel room, plane)
    - Relocation (people flying elsewhere)
    - Hierarchical: not really

### HIV/AIDS
- Disease spread differently in different regions
    - USA: mostly gay men
    - Africa: polyamorous heterosexuals, truck drivers
    - Russia: mostly drug users
    - More in urban than rural areas
- Prevention: abstinence, protection, monogamy
- Poor countries have less to spend on health care

### Common Diseases
- Malaria
    - Spread by mosquitoes
    - Infects red blood cells
    - Can be dormant for 3 years
    - Mosquitoes live in stagnant water
    - Control: 
        - Population:
            - Resettle humans
            - Economic development
        - Habitat:
            - Bug spray walls
            - bug nets
            - Treat still water with pesticides
            - Introduce predators (bats, frogs)
        - Behaviour:
            - Increase awareness
            - Vaccination
- Tuberculosis
    - Infects lungs
    - Very contagious (coughing, speaking, sneezing)
    - Control: isolate infected patients
- Yellow Fever
    - Spread by mosquitoes
    - Causes high fever
    - Endemic in Africa
    - Control: vaccination
- Diarrhea
    - Symptom of many agents
    - Control: provide clean drinking water (very expensive)
    - Focus: combat dehydration effect
- Influenza
    - Can cause pneumonia
    - Control: vaccination
        - Challenging to identify the new strain

### Snapshot of Global Health
- Physicians per 10000 people
    - Higher in Russia, Argentina, Europe, North Korea
    - Reason: Communism, Cultural values, government priorities
- Access to Safe Drinking Water
    - Low in Africa
    - Reason: Poverty
- Access to Proper Sanitation
    - Low in Africa
    - High in developed countries
    - Reason: poverty
- Undernourished Population
    - More in Africa

### Geography of Health Care
- Poverty reduces access to good health care
- Some countries (UK, Canada) have universal health care
- Location of Health Care
    - Not evenly dispersed by region
    - Poorer neighbourhoods usually have worse health care availability
- Access of Health Care
    - Cultural effects
        - e.g Spanish-speaking Americans have a harder time getting health care
- Factors
    - **Functional**: presence / absence of health care resources
        - e.g Location of hospitals
    - **Geographical**: proximity of resources to population
        - e.g Urban vs Rural
    - **Social**: racism, sexism, ageism, language
    - **Financial**: cost
        - e.g Ambulance cost
