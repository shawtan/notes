# ENGL 306A: Linguistics

## Introduction

### Saussure
- A 'word' only has value, identity within a particular linguistic system
- System change = word change
- The past (etymology) is irrelevant

### Patterns
- Evolution of language creates consistent patterns and rules
- e.g Plural forms follow patterns (-s)

#### Exceptions
- Languages are not designed, they evolve due to historical events (e.g wars, contact with foreign language)
- e.g am/is/are/was/were
- Languages will change when used

### Language System levels
1. System of sound patterns (Phonology)
2. System of words (Morphology)
3. Rules for combining words into sentences (Syntax)
4. Rules for employing sentences in discourse (Pragmatics)

### Phonology
- Each language uses certain sounds and not others
    - e.g 'th' sound in english is not in italian/german
    - This makes new, differnet words possible

### Morphology
- Endings that change the meanings of words (e.g -tion, -ment, -er)
- Endings that change the grammatical significance of words (e.g -s)
- Plurals
    - English has single or multiple
    - Hebrew differentiates single, dual, multiple

### Syntax
- English: Subject - verb - object

### Challenge: Chomsky
- Agrees: linguistics is used to describe the system of language a native speaker knows
- Conflict: Linguistics needs to explain how speakers create and understant new sentences

# Phonology
## Phonetics
- Study of the production of linguistic sounds
- How are sounds produced?
- Which elements of sound are important?

### Elements of sound
1. Initiation
    - Breathe through diaphragm, lungs
2. Phonation
    - Sound moves up esophagus
    - Vocal cord vibrations produce voicing or voiced consonants (e.g 'z' instead of 's', 'b' instead of 'p', 'g' vs 'k', 'v' vs 'f')
3. Articulation
    - Tongue, teeth, mouth movement to make different sounds by changing flow of air
    - Consonant = airflow is obstructed or constricted in some way
    - Vowel = no airflow constriction, vocal cavity is shaped
    - Actually not a clear distinction
4. Resonation
    - Sound resonate in nasal cavity and oral cavity

### Letters and Sound
- Letters are a poor representation of sound (e.g -ough, /f/)
- Writing systems are usually borrowed and don't work well with the languages
- So double letters or diacritical marks are used to represent sounds
- Writing systems stabilize, while sounds still change
- Words are borrowed from other languages
- Word derivation wants to keep consistent spelling even if it's pronounced differently (e.g canada vs canadian, photo vs photograph)
- Solution: Phonetic Transcription

### Phonetic Transcription
- International Phonetic Alphabet aims to transcribe sounds as accurately as possible

### Articulation: Consonants
- Defined by manner of articulation and place of articulation
- Manner of articulation
    - Obstruents: airflow is obstructed (t,f,g,s)
    - Sonorants: airflow not obstructed (r,l,m,n)
- Place of Articulation
    - Bilabial
    - Labiodental
    - Dental
    - Alveolar
    - Palatal
    - Velar
    - Glottal


#### Obstruents
- Stops (plosives): airflow is blocked
    - unvoiced: [p,k,t],
    - voiced: [b,g,d]
- Fricatives: narrow gap for air to pass through
    - unvoiced: [f,s,th,sh],
    - voiced: [v,z,the,g]
- Affricates: stop followed by fricative
    - unvoiced: [ch]
    - voiced: [j]

#### Sonorants
- Nasals: air forced through nasal cavity: [m,n]
- Approximants:
    - Liquids: [r, l]
    - Glides: [y,w] are actually unstable vowels (combo of two vowel sounds)

#### Place of Articulation
- Movable aritculaor (tongue / lips) moves towards a setable articulator (teeth, palate, etc)
- Bilabial: lips together
    - [p,b,m,w]
- Labiodental: lower lip to upper teeth
    - [f,v]
- Dental: tip of tongue to upper teeth
    - [th,the]
- Alveolar: top of tongue to alveolar ridge
    - [t,d,s,z,n,l]
- Palatal: tonge to back part of ridge
    - [sh,j,y,ch]
- Velar: tongue back to soft palate
    - [k,g,n]
- Glottal: obstruct airflow in vocal tract
    - used in british and other languages
    - `h` in 'hat'

See chart

### Vowels
- Hard to define
- Frontness
    - Front vs Back: [beat, boot, bought]
- Height
    - Close vs Open [beat, bit, bet, bat]
- Diphthongs: double vowels that move from one articulation to another (very common in english) (e.g [ai]: pie, eye, [ao]: now)
    - Rising dipthongs: move towards high vowel
    - Centring diphthongs: move towards eh

## Phonology
- Meaning of sounds

### Phonemes
- Languages differ by which distinctive features they make *constrastive* (significant in distinguishing sounds)
- Language takes all possible sounds and divides them into phonemes
- Phonemes = families of similar sounds (similar enough that differences don't matter in that language)
- e.g /t/ in english (stem, ten, trip, atom, atlas, bottle, pants)
- e.g In english 'd' and 'th' are different ('den' vs 'then')
    - The difference does not matter in spanish
- *Allophones* are the different versions of a phoneme that a language allows
    - e.g 'l' in leaopart, illness, apple
- e.g New Zealand accent crosses phoneme boundaries and words sound like different words
- *Free Variation* is if allophones are randomly distributed
- *Complementary distribution* is when allophones vary according to a scheme or rule
    - Following rules of a different language is what causes accents
    - e.g Canadians raise the first vowel of dipthongs

### Syllables
- Syllables are combinations of phonemes centred on vowel sounds, liquids or nasals
- Syllables are grouped into words
- e.g English allows consonant clusters
- Syllables can be stressed
- Consists of: onset, nucleus, coda

### Phonological Processes
- Sounds get altered in use (e.g I don't know -> I dunno)

#### Elision / Deletion
- Subtracting of a phoneme in certain contexts
- e.g I dunno, you n me,
- e.g I saw him -> I saw 'em,
- e.g political -> plitical

#### Epenthesis
- Additional of a phoneme
- e.g warmth -> warmpth
- e.g athlete -> athelete

#### Assimilation
- One phoneme acquires a feature of a neighbouring phoneme
- In english -s is voiced if it follows a voiced consonant / vowel, unvoiced if following unvoiced
    - e.g dogs vs pets, cats vs dogs
- Voiced consonants lose their voice if followed by an unvoiced consonant
    - e.g news vs newspaper

#### Palatalization
- Consonants followed by the glide /j/('y') are palatized
- e.g did you -> didya

#### Vowel Reduction
- Unstressed vowels are reduced to /ǝ/
- e.g canada -> can-eh-da, canadian -> ku-nai-dian
- e.g department -> duh partment

### Phonological Rules
- Relevant for complementary distributed allophones
- "A -> B / X__Y"
- A becomes B when preceded by X and followed by Y

#### Notation
- C = consonant, V = vowel
- Specify the phoneme (/f/)
- Classify the phoneme (voiceless stop)
- Enumerate the features of the phoneme (e.g +consonant +nasal)
- σ = syllable
- \# = word
- ∅ = null (deletion or absence)

#### Nasalization
- V -> [+ nasal] / ____ [nasal consonant]
- e.g hang

#### Aspiration of voiceless stops
- voiceless stop -> [+aspiration] / 'beginning of syllable'\_\_[stressed syllable]

#### Flap
- [+stop +alveolar] --> /r/[+vowel], [+stress]\_\_[+vowel -stress]
- e.g writer, rider

^ Will be tested

## Language Changes Over Time
- First (historical) law of language: Languages change
- Phonological Rules are similar to how languages change over time

### Types of Language Change
- Phonetic change
    - e.g processees
- New vocabulary
- Semantic change
    - e.g That's so "random"
- Morphological change: change in affixes, declensions
- Syntactic change
    - e.g That's "so" 2016

### Phonetic change: sound laws
- Addition, subtraction or changing of sounds within words
- There are 'regular' changes and 'sporadic' changes
- Regular changes alter words throughout the language
    - Take place throughout language without regard for meaning of words
- Sporadic changes only affect a random word/words

### Grimm's law
- Laws by which Latin (PIE) changed to Gothic
- PIE (Proto Indo-European) voiceless stops become voiceless fricatives
    - [p, t, k] -> [f, th, h]
    - e.g pater -> fadar -> father
    - e.g tres -> three
- PIE voiced stops become voiceless stops
    - [b, d, g] -> [p, t, k]
    - e.g decem -> taihun -> ten
- PIE voiced aspirates become voiced stops or fricatives
    - [bh, dh, gh] -> [b, d, g]
    - e.g fero -> baira -> bear

#### Exceptions
- Latin `sto` -> `stand` (voiceless t didnt fricative)
    - New rule: voiceless stops after fricative don't change
- Latin `dies` -> `day` (voiced stop stayed voiced)
    - Reason: English 'day' is not from 'dies', 'dies' became 'tues' (in Tuesday)

### Types of Phonetic change
- Assimilation
    - When a sound acquires characteristics of a neighbouring sound
    - e.g English plurals
- Weakening
    - Vocal articulation necessary to produce a sound is weakened
    - e.g better 't' becomes a glottal stop / flap
    - e.g Latin 'videre' -> Spanish 'veer'
- Loss
    - Loss often affects endings
    - Loss of consonant causes compensatory lengthening of vowel
    - e.g stanas -> stones
- Gain (Epenthesis)
    - Addition of vowel before consonant clusters
- Chain shift
    - One sound change causes other sounds to shift in response
    - e.g Chicago
        - Ann -> Ian
        - John -> Jan
    - e.g The Great Vowel Shift (1400 - 1800)
        - bat -> bate -> beat -> beet -> bite
        - boat -> boot -> bout

# Morphology

## Challenges
- A word can be two words (e.g wet suit)
- A word often has multiple meaningful units (e.g establish/ment/s)

## Morphology
- Study of smallest meaningful units in a language
- Study of how words are composed (put together)
- Morphological unit is made of phonemes

## Morpheme
- Smallest possible unit of meaningful language
- e.g house/bound
- e.g hous/ing
- e.g house/s
- e.g house

### Distinctions
- **Free morpheme**: A morpheme that can exist on its own
    - e.g 'house'
- **Bound morpheme**: Morpheme that must be attached to a free morpheme
    - e.g Affixes
    - e.g '-ing'
- **Lexical morpheme**: Carries semantic weight, are an open class
    - e.g 'house', 'dog', 'carry'
    - Usually free
    - Rare bound lexical morphemes
        - e.g (de)funct, funct(ion)
        - e.g (in)flate, (de)flate, (con)flate
- **Grammatical morpheme**: Creates or alters grammatical relations between other units, usually closed class
    - Free grammatical morphemes (Function Words): 'to', 'for', 'in'
    - Bound grammatical morphemes: '-ing', 'ly' '-s', 'in-', 'de-', 'con-'
        - **Derivational affixes**: Used to create new words
        - **Inflectional affixes**: Used to attach grammatical information
    - Grammatical morphemes cannot be combined to make new words

## Word-formation
1. Compounding: By combining two free morphemes
    - e.g Girlfriend
2. Derivation: By combining a free morpheme with a bound grammatical morpheme
    - e.g Friendly
    - If you change the grammatical form, it's a inflection
        - e.g friends
3. Clipping / Acronyms: By reducing a word, subtracting from it

### Compounds
- First morpheme usually  receives the stree
- Latter morpheme 'head' determines its word class (noun, verb, adjective)
    - Categorized as: Noun compounds, verb compounds, adjective compounds

#### Noun Compounds
- Noun + Noun
    - e.g Wheelchair, horsehair, skylight
- Adjective + Noun
    - e.g Blueberry, small talk
- Verb + Noun
    - e.g breaking point, flipchart

#### Verb Compounds
- Verb + verb
    - e.g blow-dry, sleepwalk
- Noun + verb
    - e.g manhandle
- Adjective
    - e.g dryclean

#### Adjective Compounds
- Adjective + adjective
    - e.g clear-sighted
- Adjective + noun
    - e.g gunshy, colourblind
- Adjective + verb
    - e.g stinking rich, soaking wet

#### Analysability
- Most compounds are analyzable (we can see how the compound comes from the combination)
- **Darkened compound**: Some words started as compounds, have parts that are no longer analyzable (due to sound changes)
    - e.g Cranberry (Used to be crane+berry)
- 'Outrage'
    1. Appears to be out + rage
    2. Actually from latin 'ultrage' (e.g ultra)
    3. Latin 'ult-' -> French 'out-'
    - Mistakenly analyzed by language users
    - Altered pronunciation to 'outrAge' vs 'outrage' (garbage)
    - Altered meaning to do with anger

### Derivations
- Free morpheme + 1+ bound lexical morphemes
- e.g Prefixes: un-, re-
    - Suffixes: -ful, -less, -tion
    - Infixes: not in english
    - Circumfixes: em---en (embolden)

#### Derivational vs Inflectional affixes
- Inflectional affixes
    - change the grammatical category of a word
    - Apply to all members of a linguistic category
- Derivational affixes
    - create new words
    - can only be attached to certain free morphemes (stems)

## Inflectional Morphology
- **Inflection** occurs when something (an affix) is added to a word to provide grammatical information
- Affix is often 'fused' with the free morpheme or stem
- Meaning of word doesn't change, but we know about the context
- Not all languages are inflected

### Affixes
- Bound grammatical morphemes
- Can be derivational or inflectional
- Classified by how they attach to other morphemes
    - Prefixes: (re)turn, (pre)view, (dis)engage
    - Suffixes: turn(ing), engage(ment), view(er)
    - Infixes: Not in english, goes in the middle of a word
    - Circumfixes: (em)bold(en), (en)light(en)

### How Grammar Information is conveyed
- e.g "My father loves my sister"
    - English: word order tells us who liked whom, subject precedes verb followed by object
    - Russian: suffixes for persons will indicate who loves whom
    - Mohawk: prefix determines who loves whom, and genders
- In some languages, every word is a single morpheme
- Isolating / Analytic language
    - e.g Mandarin
- Synthetic language
    - Agglutinative: morphemes are added to a stem and each morpheme contains one bit of information
        - e.g Finnish, Turkish
    - Inflecting (Fusional): morphemes are added and usually fuse with the stem
        - Morphemes contain several bits of information
    - Polysysnthetic
        - Words are composed of several morphemes and 1+ stem
        - e.g Mohawk: words get really long and descriptive

### Inflecting languages
- More than one morpheme per word
- Bound grammatical morphemes express more than one grammatical distinction
    - e.g Italian parl(o), -o means 1st person, singular, present tense, indicative
    - e.g Latin has a lot of inflection
    - e.g French (conjugations)

#### English Inflections
- Nouns
    - Plural: -s (Cars)
    - Genitive: -'s (Bob's car)
- Adjective
    - Comparative: -er
    - Superlative: -est
- Pronouns
    - Nominative he, she, they
    - Accusative/Dative/Prepositional: him, her, them
    - Genitive: his, her(s), their(s)
- Verbs
    - 3rd person singular: -s
    - Progressive: -ing
    - Past: -ed
    - Past participle: -en, -ed
- e.g `she talks`
    - Indicates: 3rd person, present, not continuous, indicative mood
- Inflected verb must agree with pronoun

#### Agreement
- Pronoun and verb inflections must agree
- e.g 'I talks', 'one cows'
- Important in inflected languages

### Alternatives to inflection
- Ablaut (Vowel Mutation)
    - e.g I write vs I wrote vs I have written
- Suppletion
    - e.g I go, they went

### Inflection vs Word Order
- English determines objects and subjects using word order
- Word order: 'The woman gave the man a sandwich' vs 'The woman gave the sandwich a man'
- Inflection: 'She gave him a sandwich', 'Him she gave a sandwich'

## Morphological Analysis
- Break a word into its constituent morphemes by retracing the steps of building it
    - DA = Derivational Affix
    - IA = Inflectional Affix
    - V = Verb
    - Adj = adjective
    - N = Noun
    - BL = Bound lexical morpheme?
- e.g Refocusing
    1. Split into parts: re/focus/ing
    2. Determine order parts were combined (usually derivations > inflections): ((re)(focus))(ing)
![morphological tree](morphological_tree.png)

### Ambiguities
- e.g Reusable
    - re/use/able
    - ((re)(use))(able)
- e.g Unusable
    - un/use/able
    - (un)((use)(able))
- e.g Housebuying
    - house/buy/ing
    - (house)((buy)(ing))
    - Is a gerund
- e.g Reasonableness
    - Reason/able/ness
    - (Reason/able)/ness
    - N, DA, DA
    - Adj,
    - Noun
- e.g blowdryer
    - blow/dry/er
    - blow/(dry/er)
    - verb, adj, derivational adjective
    - n
    - n
- e.g Intentionally
    - In/tent/ion/al/ly
    - (((In/tent)/ion)/al)ly
    - D-aff, BL, DN, DA, D-Affix
    - V > N > Adj > Adv
- e.g Deregulation
    - De/regul/at/ion (de-/regul(ar)/-ate/-tion)
    - DA, V, DN
    - Verb > Noun

# Syntax
## Words as Language Units
- Words are the immediate constituents of sentences
- A broken down sentence is a sequence of words
- Languages are a collection of words (**lexicon**)
- Words bear meaning
    - Words can develop new meanings separate from their parts
        - e.g trailer =/= trail-er
        - e.g establishment =/= establish-ment
        - e.g officious =/= office-ous

## Word
- Not defined by meaningful unit
    - Suffixes have meaning
    - Some words don't have meaning by itself (e.g in)
- Not defined by spacing
    - Some two word words have its own meaning
- Defined by ability to be moved around in a sentence
    - Different words fit different slots -> Word classes

## Word Classes
- Content Words
    - Nouns
    - Verbs
    - Adjectives
    - Adverbs
    - _Open class_
    - Semantically important
- Function Words
    - Pronouns
    - Propositions
    - Determiners
    - Conjunctions
    - Determiners ('the', 'a', demonstratives, possessives, quantifiers)
    - Degree words
    - _Closed class_

### Determining Word Class
- Semantically: by its meaning
- Morphology: what kind of affixes and morphological change does it employ
    - e.g Can you make it plural
- Syntactically: Where and how is it used in a sentence

### Nouns
- Semantics: Signifies concrete or abstract 'objects'
    - e.g cars, birds, love, dedication
- Morphology: Can take plural endings (-s, -es) and genitive clitics (-'s)
- Syntax: Part of subject or object of sentence
    - Agrees with verbs
    - Can be preceded by adjectives and determiners

### Verbs
- Semantics: designate processes, activities
- Morphology: conjugated according to person, number, tense, aspect, mood
- Syntax: connect to a subject
    - Can be modified by an adverb or adverbial phrase
    - Take complements (verb is used as the object of another verb)
        - e.g I *asked* her to *leave*

### Adjectives
- Semantics: designate an attribute of something or a quality
- Morphology: no case endings, can take comparative endings (-er, -est)
    - can be derived from nouns using suffixes (-y, -ful, -less)
- Syntax: can be a complement to a verb phrase (e.g "The sky is blue")
    - Can be before a noun that it modifies
    - Cannot be the subject or object in a sentence

### Adverbs
- Semantics: designate an attribute of an activity
- Morphology: no case endings
    - many end in `-ly`
- Syntax: Appear before or after what they modify
    - Can modify anything but a noun (including adjectives)

### Pronouns
- Semantics: refers to a person or thing already referred to
- Morphology: declined for genitive, sccusative/dative cases
    - inflected
    - e.g he, his, him
- Syntax: like nouns

### Prepositions
- e.g in, to, for, at, with, about, near, of
- Semantics: refers to relations between things or between an action and its object
- Morphology: invariant
- Syntax: always linked to a prepositional object
    - prepositional phrases can function as complements to verbs
    - or modifying a verb or noun phrase

### Determiners
- e.g the, a, this, that, these/those
- Semantics:
- Morphology: generally invariant, except these/those
- Syntax: front of noun phrases

### Conjunctions
- e.g and, or, but
- Semantics:
- Morphology: invariant
- Syntax: connect words, phrases or independent clauses
- Types:
    - coordinating: elements are conjoined in parallel
        - e.g and, or, but, yet, so
    - subordinating: one element becomes a subpart of the other
        - e.g that, when, if, after, because, although, wherever
    - correlative: links things, but requires both parts
        - e.g TODO

### Degree Words
- e.g very, so, too, always, perhaps
- Semantics:
- Morphology: invariant
- Syntax: appear before adjectives and adverbs

### Ambiguities
- Words in different classes may have the same suffixes
    - e.g approaches
- Words in different classes may have the same form
    - e.g "the fast bus" vs "he runs fast"
- Verbs can be used as nouns (gerunds)
    - e.g "Running was his favourite sport"
- Adjectives can be used as nouns
    - e.g "Empty was the feeling he had"
- Adverbs can be used as a degree word
    - e.g "he was terribly dull"
- Phrase or clauses (composed of different word classes) can function like an adverb, adjective
    - e.g "He taught his class with extraordinary enthusiasm"

## Sources of New words
- Derivation (adding affixes)
- Borrowing from other languages
- Formal processes (compounding, clipping, blending, acronyms, word-class conversion, back-derivation)
- Word can change its meaning (this makes it a new word)

### Borrowing
- People move around, trade and interact with other languages
- Words are adapted to sound patterns of host language
- 70%+ of modern english is borrowed
- e.g Pronouns
    - German: I, thou, she/he, you
    - Scandinavian: they
- e.g Adaptation
    - pay-jamahs (Persian) -> pyjamas
    - segankw (Abenaki) -> skunk
- Loan words look different from other english words

### Formal Processes
- Compounding: Make new words by sticking together existing words
    - e.g air + port
    - e.g wind + surfing
- Clipping: Take a word and delete part of it
    - e.g hamburger -> burger
    - e.g professor -> prof
    - e.g demonstration -> demo
    - e.g network -> internet -> net
- Blending: take a bit of each word and combine them
    - e.g smoke + fog -> smog
    - e.g motor + hotel -> motel
    - e.g breakfast + lunch -> brunch
    - e.g wireless + fidelity -> wifi (also analogy to `hifi`)
    - e.g waterloo + card -> watcard
- Acronyms
    - Letter enunciation:
        - e.g PR, TV, R&R, USA,
    - Pronounced:
        - e.g RADAR, NASA, AIDS, DOS,
- Back-derivation: create new words based on another new word
    - e.g stage + manager -> stagemanager -> stagemanage
    - e.g tele + vision -> television -> televise
    - e.g firefighter -> firefight

### Meaning to make words
- A sound pattern is not a word until it becomes meaningful
- e.g Same sound, different meaning
    - 'Yellow blue tibia' means 'I love you' in russian

#### What does meaning mean?
- *Signifier*: Concept or idea attached to the sound pattern
- *Reference*: Thing in the world that the sound pattern refers to
- We call signifier 'meaning'

### Semantics
- Study of the meanings of words
- Concerned with
    - nature of meaning

#### Networks of meaning
- Words acquire new meanings over time
- Words gain a network of related meanings
- e.g Trip has many related meanings (walk, journey, stumble, stumble in speech)
- e.g School
    1. Institute of learning
    2. Lessons
    3. Students and staff
    4. Group of people with similar views ('school of thought')
    5. group of artists with the same style
    6. group of fish (actually from dutch)
    7. an educational experience ('school of life')
    8. to outwit or display mastery ('to school someone')

#### Meaning Evolution
- Metonym: refer to something they represent as the whole thing
    - e.g 'Ottawa' as a parliament hill
- Metaphor: the thing said is like the thing referred to
    - Way for words to acquire new meaning
- Generalization
    - e.g 'Schooling is important' refers to every kind of education
- Word-class conversion: When one kind of word is used like another kind of word
    - e.g old school ('school' as adjective)
    - e.g to school someone ('school' has a verb)
    - Often the stress on the word changes
    - e.g 'computer' was a person who made calculations
        - Became: Device/machine for preforming calculations

### Onomasiology
- Look at the meaning, of the word and then the name

#### Lexical Fields
- e.g lexical field of animals
    - dogs, cats, snakes
    - No unity
    - Comes from a variety of sources
        - Adjective forms are from latin
        - Food forms are from french
    - Has distinctive words for males, females, children, groups
- e.g lexical field of chemistry is more homogeneous
- Lexical field reveals historical technologies
