# ENGL 306A: Linguistics

## Lecture 3 (01/15)

### Saussure
- A 'word' only has value, identity within a particular linguistic system
- System change = word change
- The past (etymology) is irrelevant

### Patterns
- Evolution of language creates consistent patterns and rules
- e.g Plural forms follow patterns (-s)

#### Exceptions
- Languages are not designed, they evolve due to historical events (e.g wars, contact with foreign language)
- e.g am/is/are/was/were
- Languages will change when used

### Language System levels
1. System of sound patterns (Phonology)
2. System of words (Morphology)
3. Rules for combining words into sentences (Syntax)
4. Rules for employing sentences in discourse (Pragmatics)

### Phonology
- Each language uses certain sounds and not others
    - e.g 'th' sound in english is not in italian/german
    - This makes new, differnet words possible

### Morphology
- Endings that change the meanings of words (e.g -tion, -ment, -er)
- Endings that change the grammatical significance of words (e.g -s)
- Plurals
    - English has single or multiple
    - Hebrew differentiates single, dual, multiple

### Syntax
- English: Subject - verb - object

### Challenge: Chomsky
- Agrees: linguistics is used to describe the system of language a native speaker knows
- Conflict: Linguistics needs to explain how speakers create and understant new sentences

## Phonetics
- Study of the production of linguistic sounds
- How are sounds produced?
- Which elements of sound are important?

### Elements of sound
1. Initiation
    - Breathe through diaphram, lungs
2. Phonation
    - Sound moves up esophagus
    - Vocal cord vibrations produce voicing or voiced consonants (e.g 'z' instead of 's', 'b' instead of 'p', 'g' vs 'k', 'v' vs 'f')
3. Articulation
    - Tongue, teeth, mouth movement to make different sounds by changing flow of air
    - Consonant = airflow is obstructed or constricted in some way
    - Vowel = no airflow constriction, vocal cavity is shaped
    - Actually not a clear distinction
4. Resonation
    - Sound resonate in nasal cavity and oral cavity

### Letters and Sound
- Letters are a poor representation of sound (e.g -ough, /f/)
- Writing systems are usually borrowed and don't work well with the languages
- So double letters or diacritical marks are used to represent sounds
- Writing systems stablize, while sounds still change
- Words are borrowed from other languages
- Word derivation wants to keep consistent spelling even if it's pronounced differently (e.g canada vs canadian, photo vs photograph)
- Solution: Phonetic Transcription

### Phonetic Transcription
- International Phonetic Alphabet aims to transcribe sounds as accurately as possible

### Articulation: Consonants
- Defined by manner of articulation and place of articulation
- Manner of articulation
    - Obstruents: airflow is obstructed (t,f,g,s)
    - Sonorants: airflow not obstructed (r,l,m,n)

#### Obstruents
- Stops (plosives): airflow is blocked
    - unvoiced: [p,k,t],
    - voiced: [b,g,d]
- Fricatives: narrow gap for air to pass through
    - unvoiced: [f,s,th,sh],
    - voiced: [v,z,the,g]
- Affricates: stop followed by ficative
    - unvoiced: [ch]
    - voiced: [j]

#### Sonorants
- Nasals: air forced through nasal cavity: [m,n]
- Approximants:
    - Liquids: [r, l]
    - Glides: [y,w] are actually unstable vowels (combo of two vowel sounds)

#### Place of Articulation
- Movable aritculaor (tongue / lips) moves towards a setable articulator (teeth, palate, etc)
- Bilabial: lips together
    - [p,b,m,w]
- Labiodental: lower lip to upper teeth
    - [f,v]
- Dental: tip of tongue to upper teeth
    - [th,the]
- Alveolar: top of tongue to alveolar ridge
    - [t,d,s,z,n,l]
- Palatal: tonge to back part of ridge
    - [sh,j,y,ch]
- Velar: tongue back to soft palate
    - [k,g,n]
- Glottal: used in british and other langs

### Vowels
- Hard to define
- Frontness
    - Front vs Back: [i,e,o]
- Height
    - Close vs Open
- Diphthongs: double vowels that move from one articulation to another (very common in english) (e.g [ai]: pie, eye, [ao]: now)
    - Rising dipthongs: move towards high vowel
    - Centring diphthongs: move towards eh

## Phonology
- Meaning of sounds

### Phonemes
- Languages differ by which distinctive features they make *constrastive* (significant in distinguishing sounds)
- Language takes all possible sounds and divides them into phonemes
- Phonemes = families of similar sounds (similar enough that differences don't matter in that language)
- e.g /t/ in english (stem, ten, trip, atom, atlas, bottle, pants)
- e.g In english 'd' and 'th' are different ('den' vs 'then')
    - The difference does not matter in spanish
- *Allophones* are the different versions of a phoneme that a language allows
    - e.g 'l' in leaopart, illness, apple
- e.g New Zealand accent crosses phoneme boundaries and words sound like different words
- *Free Variation* is if allophones are randomly distributed
- *Complementary distribution* is when allophones vary according to a scheme or rule
    - Following rules of a different language is what causes accents
    - e.g Canadians raise the first vowel of dipthongs

### Syllables
- Syllables are combinations of phonemes centred on vowel sounds, liquids or nasals
- Syllables are grouped into words
- e.g English allows consonant clusters
- Syllables can be stressed
- Consists of: onset, nucleus, coda

### Phonological Processes
- Sounds get altered in use (e.g I don't know -> I dunno)

#### Elision / Deletion
- Subtracting of a phoneme in certain contexts
- e.g I dunno, you n me,
- e.g I saw him -> I saw 'em,
- e.g political -> plitical

#### Epenthesis
- Additional of a phoneme
- e.g warmth -> warmpth
- e.g athlete -> athelete

#### Assimilation
- One phoneme acquires a feature of a neighbouring phoneme
- In english -s is voiced if it vollows a voiced consonant / vowel, unvoiced if following unvoiced
    - e.g dogs vs pets, cats vs dogs
- Voiced consonants lowe their voice is followed by an unvoiced consonant
    - e.g news vs newspaper

#### Palatalization
- Consonants followed by the glide /j/('y') are palatized
- e.g did you -> didya

#### Vowel Reduction
- Unstressed vowels are reduced to /ǝ/
- e.g canada -> can-eh-da, canadian -> ku-nai-dian
- e.g department -> duh partment

### Phonological Rules
- Relevant for complementary distributed allophones
- "A -> B / X__Y"
- A becomes B when preceeded by X and followed by Y

#### Notation
- C = consonant, V = vowel
- Specify the phoneme (/f/)
- Classify the phoneme (voiceless stop)
- Enumerate the features of the phoneme (e.g +consonant +nasal)
- σ = syllable
- # = word
- ∅ = null (deletion or absence)

#### Nasalization
- V -> [+ nasal] / ____ [nasal consonant]
- e.g hang

#### Aspiration of voiceless stops
- voiceless stop -> [+aspiration] / 'beginning of syllable'\_\_[stressed syllable]

#### Flap
- [+stop +alveolar] --> /r/[+vowel], [+stress]\_\_[+vowel -stress]
- e.g writer, rider

## Language Changes Over Time
- First (historical) law of language: Languages change
- Phonological Rules are similar to how languages change over time

### Types of Language Change
- Phonetic change
    - e.g processees
- New vocabulary
- Semantic change
    - e.g That's so "random"
- Morphological change: change in affixes, declensions
- Syntactic change
    - e.g That's "so" 2016

### Phonetic change: sound laws
- Addition, subtraction or changing of sounds within words
- There are 'regular' changes and 'sporadic' changes
- Regular changes alter words throughout the language
    - Take place throughout language without regard for meaning of words
- Sporadic changes only affect a random word/words

### Grimm's law
- Laws by which Latin (PIE) changed to Gothic
- PIE (Proto Indo-European) voiceless stops become voiceless fricatives
    - e.g pater -> fadar -> father
- PIE voiced stops become voiceless stops
    - e.g decem -> taihun -> ten
    - e.g fero -> baira -> bear
- PIE voiced aspirates become voiced stops or fricatives

#### Exceptions
- Latin `sto` -> `stand` (voiceless t didnt fricative)
    - New rule: voiceless stops after fricative don't change
- Latin `dies` -> `day` (voiced stop stayed voiced)
    - Reason: English 'day' is not from 'dies', 'dies' became 'tues' (in Tuesday)

### Types of Phonetic change
- Assimilation
    - When a sound acquires characteristics of a neighbouring sound
    - e.g English plurals
- Weakening
    - Vocal articulation necessary to produce a sound is weakened
    - e.g better 't' becomes a glottal stop / flap
    - e.g Latin 'videre' -> Spanish 'veer'
- Loss
    - Loss often affects endings
    - Loss of consonant causes compensatory lengthing of vowel
    - e.g stanas -> stones
- Gain (Epenthesis)
    - Addition of vowel before consonant clusters
- Chain shift
    - One sound change causes other sounds to shift in response
    - e.g Chicago
        - Ann -> Ian
        - John -> Jan
    - e.g The Great Vowel Shift (1400 - 1800)
        - bat -> bate -> beat -> beet -> bite
        - boat -> boot -> bout
