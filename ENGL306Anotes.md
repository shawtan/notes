# ENGL 306A: Linguistics

## Introduction

### Saussure
- A 'word' only has value, identity within a particular linguistic system
- System change = word change
- The past (etymology) is irrelevant

### Patterns
- Evolution of language creates consistent patterns and rules
- e.g Plural forms follow patterns (-s)

#### Exceptions
- Languages are not designed, they evolve due to historical events (e.g wars, contact with foreign language)
- e.g am/is/are/was/were
- Languages will change when used

### Language System levels
1. System of sound patterns (Phonology)
2. System of words (Morphology)
3. Rules for combining words into sentences (Syntax)
4. Rules for employing sentences in discourse (Pragmatics)

### Phonology
- Each language uses certain sounds and not others
    - e.g 'th' sound in english is not in italian/german
    - This makes new, differnet words possible

### Morphology
- Endings that change the meanings of words (e.g -tion, -ment, -er)
- Endings that change the grammatical significance of words (e.g -s)
- Plurals
    - English has single or multiple
    - Hebrew differentiates single, dual, multiple

### Syntax
- English: Subject - verb - object

### Challenge: Chomsky
- Agrees: linguistics is used to describe the system of language a native speaker knows
- Conflict: Linguistics needs to explain how speakers create and understant new sentences

# Phonology
## Phonetics
- Study of the production of linguistic sounds
- How are sounds produced?
- Which elements of sound are important?

### Elements of sound
1. Initiation
    - Breathe through diaphram, lungs
2. Phonation
    - Sound moves up esophagus
    - Vocal cord vibrations produce voicing or voiced consonants (e.g 'z' instead of 's', 'b' instead of 'p', 'g' vs 'k', 'v' vs 'f')
3. Articulation
    - Tongue, teeth, mouth movement to make different sounds by changing flow of air
    - Consonant = airflow is obstructed or constricted in some way
    - Vowel = no airflow constriction, vocal cavity is shaped
    - Actually not a clear distinction
4. Resonation
    - Sound resonate in nasal cavity and oral cavity

### Letters and Sound
- Letters are a poor representation of sound (e.g -ough, /f/)
- Writing systems are usually borrowed and don't work well with the languages
- So double letters or diacritical marks are used to represent sounds
- Writing systems stablize, while sounds still change
- Words are borrowed from other languages
- Word derivation wants to keep consistent spelling even if it's pronounced differently (e.g canada vs canadian, photo vs photograph)
- Solution: Phonetic Transcription

### Phonetic Transcription
- International Phonetic Alphabet aims to transcribe sounds as accurately as possible

### Articulation: Consonants
- Defined by manner of articulation and place of articulation
- Manner of articulation
    - Obstruents: airflow is obstructed (t,f,g,s)
    - Sonorants: airflow not obstructed (r,l,m,n)

#### Obstruents
- Stops (plosives): airflow is blocked
    - unvoiced: [p,k,t],
    - voiced: [b,g,d]
- Fricatives: narrow gap for air to pass through
    - unvoiced: [f,s,th,sh],
    - voiced: [v,z,the,g]
- Affricates: stop followed by ficative
    - unvoiced: [ch]
    - voiced: [j]

#### Sonorants
- Nasals: air forced through nasal cavity: [m,n]
- Approximants:
    - Liquids: [r, l]
    - Glides: [y,w] are actually unstable vowels (combo of two vowel sounds)

#### Place of Articulation
- Movable aritculaor (tongue / lips) moves towards a setable articulator (teeth, palate, etc)
- Bilabial: lips together
    - [p,b,m,w]
- Labiodental: lower lip to upper teeth
    - [f,v]
- Dental: tip of tongue to upper teeth
    - [th,the]
- Alveolar: top of tongue to alveolar ridge
    - [t,d,s,z,n,l]
- Palatal: tonge to back part of ridge
    - [sh,j,y,ch]
- Velar: tongue back to soft palate
    - [k,g,n]
- Glottal: used in british and other langs

See chart

### Vowels
- Hard to define
- Frontness
    - Front vs Back: [i,e,o]
- Height
    - Close vs Open
- Diphthongs: double vowels that move from one articulation to another (very common in english) (e.g [ai]: pie, eye, [ao]: now)
    - Rising dipthongs: move towards high vowel
    - Centring diphthongs: move towards eh

## Phonology
- Meaning of sounds

### Phonemes
- Languages differ by which distinctive features they make *constrastive* (significant in distinguishing sounds)
- Language takes all possible sounds and divides them into phonemes
- Phonemes = families of similar sounds (similar enough that differences don't matter in that language)
- e.g /t/ in english (stem, ten, trip, atom, atlas, bottle, pants)
- e.g In english 'd' and 'th' are different ('den' vs 'then')
    - The difference does not matter in spanish
- *Allophones* are the different versions of a phoneme that a language allows
    - e.g 'l' in leaopart, illness, apple
- e.g New Zealand accent crosses phoneme boundaries and words sound like different words
- *Free Variation* is if allophones are randomly distributed
- *Complementary distribution* is when allophones vary according to a scheme or rule
    - Following rules of a different language is what causes accents
    - e.g Canadians raise the first vowel of dipthongs

### Syllables
- Syllables are combinations of phonemes centred on vowel sounds, liquids or nasals
- Syllables are grouped into words
- e.g English allows consonant clusters
- Syllables can be stressed
- Consists of: onset, nucleus, coda

### Phonological Processes
- Sounds get altered in use (e.g I don't know -> I dunno)

#### Elision / Deletion
- Subtracting of a phoneme in certain contexts
- e.g I dunno, you n me,
- e.g I saw him -> I saw 'em,
- e.g political -> plitical

#### Epenthesis
- Additional of a phoneme
- e.g warmth -> warmpth
- e.g athlete -> athelete

#### Assimilation
- One phoneme acquires a feature of a neighbouring phoneme
- In english -s is voiced if it vollows a voiced consonant / vowel, unvoiced if following unvoiced
    - e.g dogs vs pets, cats vs dogs
- Voiced consonants lowe their voice is followed by an unvoiced consonant
    - e.g news vs newspaper

#### Palatalization
- Consonants followed by the glide /j/('y') are palatized
- e.g did you -> didya

#### Vowel Reduction
- Unstressed vowels are reduced to /ǝ/
- e.g canada -> can-eh-da, canadian -> ku-nai-dian
- e.g department -> duh partment

### Phonological Rules
- Relevant for complementary distributed allophones
- "A -> B / X__Y"
- A becomes B when preceeded by X and followed by Y

#### Notation
- C = consonant, V = vowel
- Specify the phoneme (/f/)
- Classify the phoneme (voiceless stop)
- Enumerate the features of the phoneme (e.g +consonant +nasal)
- σ = syllable
- \# = word
- ∅ = null (deletion or absence)

#### Nasalization
- V -> [+ nasal] / ____ [nasal consonant]
- e.g hang

#### Aspiration of voiceless stops
- voiceless stop -> [+aspiration] / 'beginning of syllable'\_\_[stressed syllable]

#### Flap
- [+stop +alveolar] --> /r/[+vowel], [+stress]\_\_[+vowel -stress]
- e.g writer, rider

^ Will be tested

## Language Changes Over Time
- First (historical) law of language: Languages change
- Phonological Rules are similar to how languages change over time

### Types of Language Change
- Phonetic change
    - e.g processees
- New vocabulary
- Semantic change
    - e.g That's so "random"
- Morphological change: change in affixes, declensions
- Syntactic change
    - e.g That's "so" 2016

### Phonetic change: sound laws
- Addition, subtraction or changing of sounds within words
- There are 'regular' changes and 'sporadic' changes
- Regular changes alter words throughout the language
    - Take place throughout language without regard for meaning of words
- Sporadic changes only affect a random word/words

### Grimm's law
- Laws by which Latin (PIE) changed to Gothic
- PIE (Proto Indo-European) voiceless stops become voiceless fricatives
    - e.g pater -> fadar -> father
- PIE voiced stops become voiceless stops
    - e.g decem -> taihun -> ten
    - e.g fero -> baira -> bear
- PIE voiced aspirates become voiced stops or fricatives

#### Exceptions
- Latin `sto` -> `stand` (voiceless t didnt fricative)
    - New rule: voiceless stops after fricative don't change
- Latin `dies` -> `day` (voiced stop stayed voiced)
    - Reason: English 'day' is not from 'dies', 'dies' became 'tues' (in Tuesday)

### Types of Phonetic change
- Assimilation
    - When a sound acquires characteristics of a neighbouring sound
    - e.g English plurals
- Weakening
    - Vocal articulation necessary to produce a sound is weakened
    - e.g better 't' becomes a glottal stop / flap
    - e.g Latin 'videre' -> Spanish 'veer'
- Loss
    - Loss often affects endings
    - Loss of consonant causes compensatory lengthing of vowel
    - e.g stanas -> stones
- Gain (Epenthesis)
    - Addition of vowel before consonant clusters
- Chain shift
    - One sound change causes other sounds to shift in response
    - e.g Chicago
        - Ann -> Ian
        - John -> Jan
    - e.g The Great Vowel Shift (1400 - 1800)
        - bat -> bate -> beat -> beet -> bite
        - boat -> boot -> bout

# Morphology

## Challenges
- A word can be two words (e.g wet suit)
- A word often has multiple meaningful units (e.g establish/ment/s)

## Morphology
- Study of smallest meaningful units in a language
- Study of how words are composed (put together)
- Morphological unit is made of phonemes

## Morpheme
- Smallest possible unit of meaningful language
- e.g house/bound
- e.g hous/ing
- e.g house/s
- e.g house

### Distinctions
- **Free morpheme**: A morpheme that can exist on its own
    - e.g 'house'
- **Bound morpheme**: Morpheme that must be attached to a free morpheme
    - e.g Affixes
    - e.g '-ing'
- **Lexical morpheme**: Carries semantic weight, are an open class
    - e.g 'house', 'dog', 'carry'
    - Usually free
    - Rare bound lexical morphemes
        - e.g (de)funct, funct(ion)
        - e.g (in)flate, (de)flate, (con)flate
- **Grammatical morpheme**: Creates or alters grammatical relations between other units, usually closed class
    - Free grammatical morphemes (Function Words): 'to', 'for', 'in'
    - Bound grammatical morphemes: '-ing', 'ly' '-s', 'in-', 'de-', 'con-'
        - **Derivational affixes**: Used to create new words
        - **Inflectional affixes**: Used to attach grammatical information
    - Grammatical morphemes cannot be combined to make new words

## Word-formation
1. Compounding: By combining two free morphemes
    - e.g Girlfriend
2. Derivation: By combining a free morpheme with a bound grammatical morpheme
    - e.g Friendly
    - If you change the grammatical form, it's a inflection
        - e.g friends
3. Clipping / Acronyms: By reducing a word, subtracting from it

### Compounds
- First morpheme usually  receives the stree
- Latter morpheme 'head' determines its word class (noun, verb, adjective)
    - Categorized as: Noun compounds, verb compounds, adjective compounds

#### Noun Compounds
- Noun + Noun
    - e.g Wheelchair, horsehair, skylight
- Adjective + Noun
    - e.g Blueberry, small talk
- Verb + Noun
    - e.g breaking point, flipchart

#### Verb Compounds
- Verb + verb
    - e.g blow-dry, sleepwalk
- Noun + verb
    - e.g manhandle
- Adjective
    - e.g dryclean

#### Adjective Compounds
- Adjective + adjective
    - e.g clear-sighted
- Adjective + noun
    - e.g gunshy, colourblind
- Adjective + verb
    - e.g stinking rich, soaking wet

#### Analysability
- Most compounds are analysable (we can see how the compound comes from the combination)
- **Darkened compound**: Some words started as compounds, have parts that are no longer analysable (due to sound changes)
    - e.g Cranberry (Used to be crane+berry)
- 'Outrage'
    1. Appears to be out + rage
    2. Actually from latin 'ultrage' (e.g ultra)
    3. Latin 'ult-' -> French 'out-'
    - Mistakenly analysed by langauge users
    - Altered pronounciation to 'outrAge' vs 'outrage' (garbage)
    - Altered meaning to do with anger

### Derivations
- Free morpheme + 1+ bound lexical morphemes
- e.g Prefixes: un-, re-
    - Suffixes: -ful, -less, -tion
    - Infixes: not in english
    - Circumfixes: em---en (embolden)

#### Derivational cs Inflectional effixes
- Inflectional affixes change the grammatical category of a word
- Derivatio al affixes are fussier
- TODO

## Inflectional Morphology
- **Inflection** occurs when something (an affix) is added to a word to provide grammatical information
- Affix is often 'fused' with the free morpheme or stem
- Meaning of word doesn't change, but we know about the context
- Not all languages are inflected

### Affixes
- Bound grammatical morphemes
- Can be derivational or inflectional
- Classified by how they attach to other morphemes
    - Prefixes: (re)turn, (pre)view, (dis)engage
    - Suffixes: turn(ing), engage(ment), view(er)
    - Infixes: Not in english, goes in the middle of a word
    - Circumfixes: (em)bold(en), (en)light(en)

### How Grammar Information is conveyed
- e.g "My father loves my sister"
    - English: word order tells us who liked whom, subject precedes verb followed by object
    - Russian: suffixes for persons will indicate who loves whom
    - Mohawk: prefix determines who loves whom, and genders
- In some landuages, every word is a single morpheme
- Isolating / Analytic language
    - e.g Mandarin
- Synthetic language
    - Agglutinative: morphemes are added to a stem and each morpheme contains one bit of information
        - e.g Finnish, Turkish
    - Inflecting (Fusional): morphemes are added and usually fuse with the stem
        - Morphemes contain several bits of information
    - Polysysnthetic
        - Words are composed of several morphemes and 1+ stem
        - e.g Mohawk: words get really long and descriptive

### Inflecting languages
- More than one morpheme per word
- Bound grammatical morphemes express more than one grammatical distinction
    - e.g Italian parl(o), -o means 1st person, singular, present tense, indicative
    - e.g Latin has a lot of inflection
    - e.g French (conjugations)

#### English Inflections
- Nouns
    - Plural: -s (Cars)
    - Genitive: -'s (Bob's car)
- Adjective
    - Comparative: -er
    - Superlative: -est
- Pronouns
    - Nominative he, she, they
    - Accusative/Dative/Prepositional: him, her, them
    - Genitive: his, her(s), their(s)
- Verbs
    - 3rd person singular: -s
    - Progressive: -ing
    - Past: -ed
    - Past participle: -en, -ed
- e.g `she talks`
    - Indicates: 3rd person, present, not continuous, indicative mood
- Inflected verb must agree with pronoun

#### Agreement
- Pronoun and verb inflections must agree
- e.g 'I talks', 'one cows'
- Important in inflected langauges

### Alternatives to inflection
- Ablaut (Vowel Mutation)
    - e.g I write vs I wrote vs I have written
- Suppletion
    - e.g I go, they went

### Inflection vs Word Order
- English determines objects and subjects using word order
- Word order: 'The woman gave the man a sandwich' vs 'The woman gave the sandwich a man'
- Inflection: 'She gave him a sandwich', 'Him she gave a sandwich'

## Morphological Analysis
- Break a word into its constituent morphemes by retracing the steps of building it
- e.g Refocusing
    1. Split into parts: re/focus/ing
    2. Determine order parts were combined (usually derivations > inflections): ((re)(focus))(ing)
    3. TODO <Insert morphological tree image>
```
    V
   / \
  V    \
 /   \   \
 DeAff
 re     focus   ing
```

### Ambiguities
- e.g Reusable
    - re/use/able
    - ((re)(use))(able)
- e.g Unusable
    - un/use/able
    - (un)((use)(able))
- e.g Housebuying
    - house/buy/ing
    - (house)((buy)(ing))
    - Is a gerund
- e.g Reasonableness
    - Reason/able/ness
    - (Reason/able)/ness
    - N, DA, DA
    - Adj,
    - Noun
- e.g blowdryer
    - blow/dry/er
    - blow/(dry/er)
    - verb, adj, derivational adjective
    - n
    - n
- e.g Intentionally
    - In/tent/ion/al/ly
    - (((In/tent)/ion)/al)ly
    - D-aff, BL, DN, DA, D-Affix
    - V > N > Adj > Adv
- e.g Deregulation
    - De/regul/at/ion (de-/regul(ar)/-ate/-tion)
    - DA, V, DN
    - Verb > Noun

# Syntax
## Words as Language Units
- Words are the immediate constituents of sentences
- A broken down sentence is a sequence of words
- Languages are a collection of words (**lexicon**)
- Words bear meaning
    - Words can develop new meanings seperate from their parts
        - e.g trailer =/= trail-er
        - e.g establishment =/= establish-ment
        - e.g officious =/= office-ous

## Word
- Not defined by meaningful unit
    - Suffixes have meaning
    - Some words don't have meaning by itself (e.g in)
- Not defined by spacing
    - Some two word words have its own meaning
- Defined by ability to be moved around in a sentence
    - Different words fit different slots -> Word classes

## Word Classes
- Content Words
    - Nouns
    - Verbs
    - Adjectives
    - Adverbs
    - _Open class_
    - Semantically important
- Function Words
    - Pronouns
    - Propositions
    - Determiners
    - Conjunctions
    - Determiners ('the', 'a', demonstratives, possessives, quantifiers)
    - Degree words
    - _Closed class_

### Determining Word Class
- Semantically: by its meaning
- Morphology: what kind of affixes and morpological change does it employ
    - e.g Can you make it plural
- Syntactically: Where and how is it used in a sentence

### Nouns
- Semantics: Signifies concrete or abstract 'objects'
    - e.g cars, birds, love, dedication
- Morphology: Can take plural endings (-s, -es) and genitive clitics (-'s)
- Syntax: Part of subject or object of sentence
    - Agrees with verbs
    - Can be preceded by adjectives and determiners

### Verbs
- Semantics: designate processes, activities
- Morphology: conjugated according to person, number, tense, aspect, mood
- Syntax: connect to a subject
    - Can be modified by an adverb or adverbial phrase
    - Take complements (verb is used as the object of another verb)
        - e.g I *asked* her to *leave*

### Adjectives
- Semantics: designate an attribute of something or a quality
- Morphology: no case endings, can take comparative endings (-er, -est)
    - can be derived from nouns using suffixes (-y, -ful, -less)
- Syntax: can be a complement to a verb phrase (e.g "The sky is blue")
    - Can be before a noun that it modifies
    - Cannot be the subject or object in a sentence

### Adverbs
- Semantics: designate an attribute of an activity
- Morphology: no case endings
    - many end in `-ly`
- Syntax: Appear before or after what they modify
    - Can modify anything but a noun (including adjectives)

### Pronouns
- Semantics: refers to a person or thing already referred to
- Morpology: declined for genitive, sccusative/dative cases
    - inflected
    - e.g he, his, him
- Syntax: like nouns

### Prepositions
- e.g in, to, for, at, with, about, near, of
- Semantics: refers to relations between things or between an action and its object
- Morpology: invariant
- Syntax: always linked to a prepositional object
    - prepositional phrases can function as complements to verbs
    - or modifying a verb or noun phrase

### Determiners
- e.g the, a, this, that, these/those
- Semantics:
- Morpology: generally invariant, except these/those
- Syntax: front of noun phrases

### Conjunctions
- e.g and, or, but
- Semantics:
- Morpology: invariant
- Syntax: connect words, phrases or independent clauses
- Types:
    - coordinating: elements are conjoined in parallel
        - e.g and, or, but, yet, so
    - subordinating: one element becomes a subpart of the other
        - e.g that, when, if, after, because, although, wherever
    - correlative: links things, but requires both parts
        - e.g TODO

### Degree Words
- e.g very, so, too, always, perhaps
- Semantics:
- Morpology: invariant
- Syntax: appear before adjectives and adverbs

### Ambiguities
- Words in different classes may have the same suffixes
    - e.g approaches
- Words in different classes may have the same form
    - e.g "the fast bus" vs "he runs fast"
- Verbs can be used as nouns (gerunds)
    - e.g "Running was his favourite sport"
- Adjectives can be used as nouns
    - e.g "Empy was the feeling he had"
- Adverbs can be used as a degree word
    - e.g "he was terribly dull"
- Phrase or clauses (composed of differnt word classes) can function like an adverb, adjective
    - e.g "He taught his class with extraordinary enthusiasm"
