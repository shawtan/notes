# Searching

## Terminology
- Informed search: available guidance on where to find solutions
    - e.g Distance from destination
- Uninformed Search: no such information

### Problem-Solving Agents
- Goal: objective the agent is trying to achieve
- Problem: process of deciding what actions and states to consider
- Search: process of looking for the best sequence of actions

### Problem Components
- Initial state
- Possible actions
    - Successor function: state reached by applying an action
    - <action, successor> pair
    - e.g <Go(HKU), In(HKU)>
- Goal test: determines if the state is a goal state
- Path cost: numeric cost for each path (can be all 0)
- e.g 8 sliding block puzzle
- e.g 8 queens problem

## Tree Search Algorithm
- Root: node corresponding to the initial state
- Expanding current node: generating successors of already-explored states
- Search strategy: choice of which state to expand
- BFS, DFS, etc are the same algorithm with different state management

### State vs Node
- State: representation of physical configuration
- Node: data structure used for solving
    - Components:
        - State: corresponding state of the node
        - Parent node
        - Action: Action applied to parent to generate this node
        - Path-cost: cost g(n) from initial state to this node
        - Depth: number of steps from initial state
    - Nodes are put in a queue, called 'fringe'

## Performance Considerations
- Completeness
- Optimality
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Complexity is measured in terms of 
    - `b` Max branching factor
    - `d` Depth of least cost solution
    - `m` Max depth of the state space

## Uninformed Search Strategies
![image](03_search_complexity.png)

- Breadth-first Search
    - fringe = FIFO queue
    - Optimal if cost is constant
    - Time complexity: O(b^(d+1))
    - Space complexity: O(b^(d+1))
- Uniform-cost Search
    - fringe = queue ordered ascending by path cost
    - Complete if step cost is non-zero
    - Optimal
    - Time complexity: number of nodes with g <= cost of optimal solution
        - O(b^(1+\floor{C^*/\epsilon}))
    - Space complexity: number of nodes with g <= cost of optimal solution
        - O(b^(1+\floor{C^*/\epsilon}))
- Depth-first Search
    - fringe = LIFO queue
    - Complete if space is finite
    - Optimal if cost is constant
    - Time complexity: O(b^m), m is the max depth
    - Space complexity: O(bm)
- Depth-limited Search
    - Limit search depth, fail if that limit is reached
- Iterative Deepening Search
    - Depth-limited search with increasing limit
    - Combines benefits of BFS and DFS
    - Complete
    - Optimal if step cost constant
    - Time: (d+1)b^0 + db^1 + (d-1)b^2 + ... + b^d = O(b^d)
    - Space: O(bd)
- Note: Make sure repeated states are skipped
    

    
    
# Informed Search Algorithms

## Best-first search
- Heuristic funtion h(n): estimates the cheapest path from node n to a goal node

### Greedy Search
- h(n) = estimated cost from n to the closest goal
- e.g Straight-line distance between two cities
- Not complete (can get stuck in loops)
    - Complete with repeated-state checking in a finite space
- Not optimal
- Time: O(b^m), a good heuristic can give dramatic improvement
- Space: O(b^m)

### A* Search
- Look at previous cost in addition to future cost
- f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
    - g(n) = cost so far to reach n
- Requires an 'admissible' heuristic (always <= actual value)
- Optimality
    - Consistency: h(n) is consistent if for every node n and every successor n', h(n) <= c(n, a, n') + h(n')
    - A* is optimal if h(n) is consistent
    - Consistency is stricter than admissibility
    - Consistency is required for graph search
    - Admissibility is required for tree search
- Properties
    - Complete
    - Optimal (proof in slides)
    - Time: Exponential
    - Space: Exponential (risky)
- Optimally efficient for any given heuristic function (no other optimal algorithm is guaranteed to expand fewer nodes)

### Heuristic Functions
- Effective branching factor (b*): estimates the branching factor accross all nodes
- If for any node n, $h_2(n) \geq h_1(n)$, then h\_2 **dominates** h\_1 (h_2 is always better)
    - A* will never expand more nodes using h\_2 than h_1

#### 8 Puzzle Problem

- h_1(n) = number of misplaced tiles
- h_2(n) = total Manhattan distance (number of squares from correct position for each tile)

### Finding Heuristics

- The cost of an optimal solution to a relaxed problem is an admissible heuristic for the original solution

### Generating Heuristics

- Construct heuristics by defining the problem formally
- Generate relaxed problems by removing problem constraints
- Optimal solution of a relaxed problem <= optimal solution of the real problem
- $h(n) = \max(h_a(n), h_b(n))$


### Learning Heuristics

- Inductive learning, reinforcement learning

### Interactive Improvement Algorithms

- Try to improve current state step by step
- e.g n-queens: given any state, try to move a queen to reduce the number of conflicts
- e.g Hill-climbing: trying to climb to the highest point
  - Problem: Can be stuck at a local maxima
  - Plateau: Can escape with random sideways moves

### Genetic Algorithm

- Start with population of k randomly generated states
- Create the next generation, and keep the fittest k
- Next generation is chosen through:
  - Crossover: Two parents are broken at a random crossover point and concatentated
  - Mutation: Randomly change 1 symbol of the states
  - Random probabilities are weighted
- â€‹# Adversarial Search - Games

## Games vs Search Problems
- Zero-sum game: Utility for two opponents at the end is equal and opposite (+1 and -1)
- Opponent is unpredictable, so assume they are perfect
- Finding the optimal solution is infeasible due to size of search tree

### Types of Games
- Perfect information vs Imperfect information
  - How much information about the game state do we know
- Deterministic vs Chance

### Game Tree
- Initial state: beginning board position
- Successor function: (move, state)
- Terminal test: is game over? 
  - Terminal state = end states
- Utility function: numerical value of each terminal state (win, loss, draw)
  - You try to maximize utility
  - Opponent tries to minimize utility

### Optimal Strategies
- Fair game: Perfect play results in a draw
- Assume game is fair and the root node has utility 0
- \\[\text{MINIMAX-VALUE}(n)=\begin{cases}\text{UTILITY}(n) & \text{if $n$ is a terminal state}\\ \max_{s \in Successor(n)} \text{MINIMAX-VALUE}(s) & \text{if $n$ is a $\max$ node}\\ \min_{s \in Successor(n)} \text{MINIMAX-VALUE}(s) & \text{if $n$ is a $\min$ node}\end{cases}\\]
  - Complete if tree is finite
  - Optimal
  - Time: $$O(b^m)$$, b is number of legal moves at each point, m is bax depth
  - Space: $$O(bm)$$ if all successors are generated at the same time. $$O(m)$$ if only one successor is generated at the same time

### Multiplayer Games
- Need to calculate utlity for each player
- Complications: Alliances, alliance breakups

### Improvements

#### $$\alpha$$-$$\beta$$ Pruning
- Prune away branches that will not influence the final decision
- $$\alpha$$: highest-value found so far along the MAX path
- $$\beta$$: lowest-value found so far along MIN path
- If cost of $$n$$ is worse than minimax($$\alpha$$), that branch can be pruned for MAX
- If cost of $$n$$ is worse than minimax($$\beta$$), that branch can be pruned for MIN

#### Evaluation Function
- Infeasible to expand until goal state
- Use Evaluation Function to estimate the expected utility of the distance to the goal
- A good evaulation function
  - Orders terminal states the same way as the utility function
  - Easy to compute
  - Strongly correlated with the actual chance of winning
- How it works
  - Identify features of the configuration
  - Compute numerical value of each feature and combine
- Evaluation function can be learned by the program

#### Cutting off Search
- Test for cut-off point instead of terminal node
- e.g. Only look forward 5 steps
- Should only be used for quiescent states (states unlikely to have wild swings in future)

#### Horizon Effect
- Unavoidable losing move in the future
- Stalling moves are available that delay the losing move past the 'horizon' (search depth)

### Non-Deterministic Games
- Random element in game (e.g dice throw)
- Model using **chance nodes** which have the possible outcomes
- Value of the evaluation function becomes important
    - Should be a *positive linear* transformation to the actual probabilty of winning

#### Card Games
- Opponent's cards are unknown (chance)
- Use probabilty of card deals and compute expected return
- Have a expected risk to prevent disastrous decisions (e.g Die if you choose wrong)
# Constraint Satisfaction Problems

## Definition
- Set of _variables_ (`X_1, X_2, ... X_n`) from the domain D
    - Boolean variables = Boolean satisfiability problem
    - Discrete variables = finite domains
    - Continuous variables = linear programming
- Set of _constraints_ (`C_1, C_2, ... C_m`)
    - Unary contraints: involves a single variable
    - Binary contraints: invloves pairs of variables
    - Higher-order contraints: 3 or more variables
    - Preferences (Soft contraint): Cost for each assignment, optimization problem
- A _problem state_ is an assignment of variable values
    - An assignment that does not violate any constraints is _consistent_
    - An assignment with every variable is _complete_
- A _solution_ is a complete assignment that satisfies all constraints
- e.g Map colouring
    - Variables are region nodes
    - Constraints are edges between nodes

### Incremental Formulation
- Formulate as a search problem
    - Initial State: Empty assignment
    - Successor function: A value is assigned to an unassigned variable without breaking constraints
    - Goal Test: Is assignment complete?
    - Path Cost: Constant cost for every step
- Depth of tree = number of variables
    - Use DFS
- e.g Cryptarithmetic Puzzle (TWO + TWO = FOUR)

### Backtracking Search
- CSPs are _commutative_ (Order of actions have no effect on outcome)
- Use _backtracking_ where you backtrack if there are no legal value assignments left

#### Improvements to Backtracking
- Variable ordering
    - Minimum remaining values (fail-first): 
        - Choose the variable with the fewest legal moves
        - Prunes the search tree earlier
    - Degree Heuristics:
        - Choose variable involved in the largest number of contraints
        - Reduce branching factor
- Value ordering
    - Least Constraining Value
        - Choose value that rules out the fewest choices
        - Keep options open for future assignments
- Propagate information through constraints
    - Forward Checking
        - Keep track of availiable legal values for unassigned variables
        - When assigning X, check unassigned Y related to X and delete inconsistent values
        - Terminate search when no legal values exist
    - Arc Consistency
        - Forward checking through all connected nodes

### k-consistency
- A CSP is _k_-consistent if for any consistent assignment of `k-1` variables, a consistent value can be assigned to any kth variable
- Strong k-consistancy: k, k-1, ..., 1-consistent
- 1-consistency = node consistency
- 2-consistency = arc consistency

### Local Search
- Allow states with unsatisfied constraints
- Operator to reassign variable values
- Heuristic: min-conflict (violates the fewest constraints)

### Tree-structured CSPs
- Convert tree to a Directed Acylic Graph and process in that order
- 1. Backward removal to ensure parents are consistent with child
- 2. Forward assignment to assign values

### Near Tree-Structured CSPs
- If deleting node X creates a tree, assign a value to SA and delete that value from inconsistent variables


# Logical Agents

## Knowledge Base
- Set of sentences representing assertations about the world
- e.g
    - TELL: Add new sentences to knowledge base
    - ASK: query knowledge base
- Agents have two levels
    - Knowledge level: what the agents know
    - Implementation level: data structures and algorithms

## Knolwedge-Based Agent
- Represents states, actions, etc.
- Incorporates new percepts
- Updates internal representation of the world
- Deduces hidden properties of the world
- Deduces appropriate actions

### Approaches
- Declarative Approach: Knowledge is a set of sentences describing the knowledge
    - Needs a reasoning module to process queries
- Procedural Approach: Encodes the desired behaviour directly
    - More efficient

#### Example: Wumpus World
- Cave with rooms connected by passageways
- A room can contain:
    - The 'wumpus' that eats anyone who enters its room
        - Agent can shoot the wumpus, but it only has 1 arrow
    - A deep pit trapping anyone except the wumpus
    - The heap of gold

##### PEAS Description    
- Performance measure: 
    - +1000 for picking up gold, -1000 for falling into pit or being eaten, -1 per step and -10 for using the arrow. 
- Environment:
    - A 4Ã—4 grid of rooms.
    - Agent always starts at [1, 1], facing to the right.
    - Location of wumpus and gold is chosen randomly, other than the start square.
    - Each square, other than start, can be a pit with prob. 0.2
- Actuator:
    - agent can move forward, turn left or right.
    - agent dies when entering a square with a pit or live wumpus.
    - Grab â€” pick up an object in the same square.
    - Shoot â€” fire an arrow in the direction the agent is facing, only the first shoot has effect, because agent has only one arrow.
- Sensors
    - Stench: Wumpus is adjacent
    - Breeze: Pit is adjacent
    - Glitter: Room contains gold
    - Bump: Wall
    - Scream: Wumpus is killed

## Logic
- Just read your CS245 notes...
- Formal languages for representing information to draw conclusions
- Syntax: sentences in the language
- Semantics: meaning of sentences
- **Entailment**: one idea semantically follows from another
    - e.g KB |= Î± iff Î± is true in all states where KB is true
- Models: formally structured worlds used to evaluate truth

### Inference
- Soundness: If there is a proof, Ï† logically follows
	- Î£ âŠ¢ Ï† implies Î£ âŠ¨ Ï†
- Completeness: If Ï† logically follows, there is a proof
	- Î£ âŠ¨ Ï† implies Î£ âŠ¢ Ï†

### Propositional Logic Syntax
- Atomic sentences: single boolean propositional symbol
    - e.g P_1, q, TRUE
- Complex sentences: connected atomic sentences
    - e.g P âˆ§ Q, Â¬TRUE

### Inference by Enumeration
- Truth table with all possible states
- For every state where KB is true, check if Î± is true
- Sound by definition of entailment
- Complete as it works for every KB and Î±, and is guarenteed to terminate (finite states)
- 2^n models for n symbols

### Validity and Satisfiability
- Valid: True for all models
- Satisfiable: True in some models
- Unsatisfiable: True in no models

### Proof Methods
- Application of inference rules
    - Modus Ponen: (Î± => Î², Î±) => Î²
    - AND Elimination: (Î± âˆ§ Î²) => Î²
    - Other rules
- Model Checking
    - Check every state

### Forward and Backward Chaining
- Automated inference rule application
- Require KB to contain **Horn Clauses**
- Definite Clause: disjuction of literals where exactly literal is positive
- Horn Clause: disjunction of literals where at most one is positive
- Forward Chaining
    - Apply any rules whose premises are satisfied until query is found
- Backward Chaining
    - Check if query q is known already
    - If not, use premises of rules containing q

### Resolution
- Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
    - Literal - Propositional variable or its negation
    - Clause - Disjunction of literals
    - CNF - Conjunction of clauses (A bunch of OR's joined by AND's)
        - Only connectives in CNF are Â¬ âˆ¨ âˆ§
- Resolution Proof Procedure
    - To prove Ï† from Î£, via a Resolution refutation:
    1. Convert each formula in Î£ to CNF.
    2. Convert Â¬Ï† to CNF.
    3. Split the CNF formulas at the âˆ§s, yielding a set of clauses. Call them assumptions
    4. From the resulting set of clauses, keep applying the resolution inference rule until either:
        - The empty clause âŠ¥ results. In this case, Ï† is a theorem.
            - Î£ âˆª {Â¬Ï†} is a contradiction
        - The rule can no longer be applied to give a new formula. In this case, Ï† is not a theorem.
            - Î£ âˆª {Â¬Ï†} is satisfiable
- e.g {(q âˆ¨ r) â†’ s âŠ¨ q â†’ s}
    1. Â¬q âˆ¨ s   assumption
    2. Â¬r âˆ¨ s   assumption
    3. q        assumption (from negated conclusion)
    4. Â¬s       assumption (from negated conclusion)
    5. Â¬q       1, 4
    6. âŠ¥        3, 5
    - Refutation complete
# First-Order Logic
# Uncertainty
- First-Order logic can't deal with uncertainty
- Use probability to predict outcome
- Assign utility to each outcome and calculate expected utility
- Attempt to maximize utility
